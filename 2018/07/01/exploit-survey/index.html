<p>The Android operating system has been dominating the mobile device market in recent years. Although Android has actively strengthened its security mechanisms and fixed a great number of vulnerabilities as its version evolves, new vulnerabilities still keep emerging. Vulnerability exploitation is a common way to achieve privilege escalation on Android systems. In order to provide a holistic and comprehensive understanding of the exploits, we conduct a survey of publicly available 63 exploits for Android devices. Based on the analysis of the collected real-world exploits, we construct a taxonomy on Android exploitation and present the similarities/differences and strength/weakness of different types of exploits. <a id="more"></a> On the other hand, we conduct an evaluation on a group of selected exploits on our test devices. Based on both the theoretical analysis and the experimental results of the evaluation, we present our insight into the Android exploitation. The growth of exploit categories along the timeline reflects three trends:</p>
<ol>
<li>the individual exploits are more device specific and operating system version specific; </li>
<li>exploits targeting vendors’ customization grow steadily where the increase of other types of exploits slows down; and</li>
<li>memory corruption gradually becomes the primary approach to initiate exploitation.</li>
</ol>
<p>The outcome of this study is published as an article titled as <strong>A survey of Android exploits in the wild</strong> on Elsevier Computers &amp; Security. You may find the paper through this <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167404818301664" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link</a> or by searching the DOI number <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cose.2018.02.019" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10.1016/j.cose.2018.02.019</a>. </p>
<h1 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction "></a>Introduction </h1><p>mobile devices are indispensable in people’s lives nowadays. Along with the development of mobile technology and the prevalence of Internet services, smart mobile devices become the principal digital assistant that people use for information acquiring, instant messaging, online socialization, Internet financing and other Internet services. The market share of devices with Android operating system keeps growing since its release in 2008 and has been dominating the mobile system market for a long time. According to the latest market statistics done by IDC, Android managed to capture 85.0% of the worldwide smartphone market share by the 1st quarter of 2017. In the meantime, the global shipment of new Android devices is experiencing an average of 10% growth each year since 2015. Due to people’s heavy reliance on mobile devices and the popularity of Android mobile systems, the privacy concern and security issues on Android systems catch great attention from mobile users, industry players and academic researchers. At the same time, it also makes Android the prominent target of attackers. Unfortunately, Android vulnerabilities keep emerging and have successfully been turned into their exploitation even though Android has strengthened its security mechanisms and fixed a great number of vulnerabilities as its version evolves. </p>
<p>Vulnerability exploitation is a common way to achieve higher privilege on Android systems. Exploiting Android devices has been a popular topic since Android was firstly introduced in 2008. There are numerous exploits being implemented in the Android history. From the users’ perspective, an exploit program can help them to bypass the security mechanism of their Android devices to achieve better control of their devices by obtaining a higher privilege, e.g., rooting their devices. On the other hand, the exploitation could also be misused to gain the control of victims’ devices where the attacker can obtain financial profit from selling users’ privacy (e.g., account information). We intend to provide a holistic and comprehensive understanding of the exploits that can be used to attain higher privileges in Android system. It would be helpful in terms of understanding how individual exploits work and how the trend of the exploits on Android would be.<br>In this study, we are going to present a survey on all the publicly available Android exploits gathered on the Internet. We provide a taxonomy of the Android exploits and analyze the similarities/differences and strengths/weaknesses. We demonstrate the trend of Android exploits by analyzing the development of each exploit category. Furthermore, we evaluate a group of exploits on our test devices. In summary, our contribution could be summarized into three points: </p>
<ol>
<li><p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first complete and exhaustive survey on publicly available Android exploits. By analyzing each exploit, we filter out those exploits with the same way of working but different nicknames and finally distill 63 different exploits. By referring to our survey, an reader can easily find out the affected device models and Android versions of a publicly released exploit as well as the vulnerabilities behind it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>This paper conducts a comparative and in-depth analysis of existing real-world Android exploits for the first time. We propose a taxonomy and accordingly initiate a classification of these exploits. We also carry out a comparison among different types of the exploits. By analyzing similarities/differences and strengths/weaknesses of each type of exploits, we point out the evolution of exploitation throughout the history of Android and forecast the future trends of the exploitation on Android devices.</p>
</li>
<li><p>With a large volume of information of these exploits being collected, we select a group of exploits by matching their targeting devices and Android versions to our test devices. Then we conduct an experiment to validate those selected exploits. By observing the experimental results, we present our evaluation result and discuss our findings correspondingly. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In the following section, we will first propose a taxonomy on Android exploitation considering various perspectives. Next, we present the list of exploits gathered from multiple online sources, followed by analysis based on our classification results. Due to the limitation of space, the evaluation of those exploits on actual devices are not illustarated in this post. You are suggested to refer the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167404818301664" target="_blank" rel="noopener">paper</a> if you want to read the complete version of this study. Meanwhile, all kinds of academic citation are welcomed.

<h1 id="Exploitation-Taxonomy"><a href="#Exploitation-Taxonomy" class="headerlink" title="Exploitation Taxonomy "></a>Exploitation Taxonomy </h1><p>We propose a taxonomy for this survey to facilitate a holistic and comprehensive understanding of the Android exploits. With this taxonomy depicted in the figure below, we describe an exploit from 3 different perspectives - societal perspective, practical perspective, and technical perspective. From the societal aspect, we discuss who the potential attacker is, what is his or her motive in conducting the exploitation, and the possible consequence (risk) if such exploitation has been exercised. From the practical perspective, we discuss the pre-requisite for the exploitation, the steps to conduct exploitation, and the expected outcome (output) with the execution of the exploit. Finally, from the technical perspective, we discuss all the key elements of an exploit in an attack analysis model, including attack surfaces, attack vectors, and vulnerable targets.</p>
<div align="center" style="padding-bottom:15px; width:100;"><img src="/2018/07/01/exploit-survey/taxonomy.jpg">The Taxonomy of Android Exploits</div>

<h2 id="Societal-Perspectives"><a href="#Societal-Perspectives" class="headerlink" title="Societal Perspectives"></a>Societal Perspectives</h2><h3 id="S1-Attacker-and-S2-Motive"><a href="#S1-Attacker-and-S2-Motive" class="headerlink" title="(S1) Attacker and (S2) Motive"></a>(S1) Attacker and (S2) Motive</h3><p>We use the term attacker to present the role of the entity who initiates the exploitation regardless he or she is the owner of the device or has malicious intention. In consideration of moral and legal qualms, most of the exploits are introduced to the public as a tool to enable devices’ owners to gain superior privilege in their daily usage. However, it does not guarantee the exploit will never be used by people with malicious intent. Hacktivists and cyber-spies could profit from making use of exploit programs to gain control of the victims’ device stealthily without users’ consent or awareness. Thieves could continue using the stolen devices by obtaining superior privilege even if those devices have been locked by their owner. Terrorists can use exploits to control and interrupt the normal operation of people’s smartphones. Moreover, exploit may also be used by the law enforcement agencies or investigators to obtain evidence for forensic purpose.</p>
<h3 id="S3-Possible-consequence"><a href="#S3-Possible-consequence" class="headerlink" title="(S3) Possible consequence"></a>(S3) Possible consequence</h3><p>Many exploits gain privilege with some side effects such as process crash or memory tampering, which may turn target device into an unstable status or even worse like being bricked and resulting loss of warranty. However, the risk of exploitation with malicious intention is much greater than the personal usage by the device owner. Attackers may inject virus or ransomware into the exploit program and install them in the target device once the exploit program acquired the superior privilege. The virus and ransomware could then reproduce themselves to harm other target devices. By stealing the sensitive information stored on the target device, the victim may possibly suffer from financial loss and leakage of commercial secret. The society may get into chaos and panics if the exploit has been utilized by terrorist to spread horrors and sabotage the communication functions on users’ mobile devices. On the other hands, using exploits legitimately can bring greater possibility to the law enforcement agencies or investigators to find the key evidence from the devices of people involved.</p>
<h2 id="Practical-Perspectives"><a href="#Practical-Perspectives" class="headerlink" title="Practical Perspectives"></a>Practical Perspectives</h2><h3 id="P1-Execution-channel-and-P2-Condition"><a href="#P1-Execution-channel-and-P2-Condition" class="headerlink" title="(P1) Execution channel and (P2) Condition"></a>(P1) Execution channel and (P2) Condition</h3><p>Execution channel describes the approach that an attacker takes to the exploit program to conduct exploitation. Condition defines the pre-requisite that must be satisfied before the attack is exercised. An exploit may request more than one conditions to ensure a successful execution. The condition set of an exploit usually varies with the execution channel. With the knowledge of execution channel and all the necessary conditions of an exploit, we can construct a scenario to present the exploitation process on a real device. Here we define 4 different execution channels and we will discuss the conditions for each execution channel in following paragraphs.<br>App execution describes the scenario that an attacker embeds the exploit code together with super-user binary files into an APK file and installs it on the target device to exercise the exploitation. The app containing exploit payload could be installed through on-device download or USB connection. Once the APK file has been installed on the target device, the privilege escalation can be triggered by any user’s interaction within the app’s interface, or even automatically while the app is running in the background. If the malicious code has been successfully executed, the privilege of the running process will be temporarily escalated, and then a persistent root could be obtained if the process with superior privilege copied the super-user binaries to the system executable directory within the Android system (Sun et al., 2015).<br>As the crafted APK containing exploit payload has almost zero chance to be published in Google Play market due to the pre-publish security check, the attacker must make sure the target device has enabled the unknown source installation option to allow the APK installation, and followed by the execution on the target device. Moreover, if the attacker wants to manually transfer the APK file to the target device through USB connection, the attacker also need to ensure that the target device has enabled USB debugging and trusted the USB connection with the computer where the attack originates.<br>Running executable scripts or binaries on the target device could be regarded as the most direct and effective way to conduct exploitation. To exploit, the attacker needs to connect the target device with the PC through USB connection, upload the script or executable binary along with all relevant files to a temporary directory on the target device by calling Android Debug Bridge (ADB for short) push command, and then execute the scripts or binaries in an ADB shell. Compared with the app execution, shell execution comes with a lower implementation cost and higher flexibility to apply to different operating system versions or device models. In addition, a successful shell execution usually results in a shell window with superior privilege, which brings convenience and freedom to the attacker to manipulate the target device.<br>Despite the strength that shell execution exploits have, there are still some restrictions that we should not ignore while conducting binary exploitation. Before the exploitation take place, what the attacker needs includes (1) a PC with drivers for both the target device and ADB installed; (2) the physical ownership of the target device to connect the device to the PC through USB at the moment of exploitation; (3) the password to unlock the screen of the target device, if any, to grant authorization and enable USB debugging and trusted connection.<br>Remote execution is another optional execution channel to conduct exploitation on Android devices. It does not require the physical connection or APK installation. Instead, remote execution usually targets some native components of Android system, such as Webkit or media playback library, to attain the privilege escalation in distance (Seacord, 2015; Ben, 2010). In practice, the attack source may be a piece of malicious code pre-loaded into a web page or a crafted media file. The exploitation will be triggered at the moment when the target device user starts viewing or previewing the crafted web page or media file. During the execution, the attack source code could achieve privilege escalation and then initiate a remote connection between the target device and attacker’s machine, and in the end, pass the full control of the target device to the attacker.<br>Remote execution stands out from the other exploitation channels that require a physical connection, and it is one of the trends of future exploitation on Android devices owing to many advantages it has (Wei et al., 2017). Firstly, the remote execution has excellent camouflage and anonymity because it is possible to attain high privilege on Android devices without a physical connection and victim’s awareness. Moreover, as the attack originates from the network rather than local files or applications, it will be difficult for security mechanism in Android system or third-party anti-virus applications to detect the exploitation by local scanning or static analysis. Nevertheless, remote exploits still have some restriction when applying the exploitation in the wild rather than the laboratory. Even though such exploitation is physical connection free, the attacker still needs to ensure that his or her attacking device is connected to the same network with the target device and the IP address of the attacking device must be filled in the malicious payload code prior to the exploitation.<br>Besides those 3 types of common execution channels, there is an exception in the history of Android exploitation called <em>Volez</em>. <em>Volez</em> is the first ever publicly released exploit that takes advantage of one or more vulnerabilities of the target device to obtain root privilege. The <em>Volez</em> program can modify the factory OTA recovery image and insert <code>su</code> binary into the image. After that, the attacker copies the crafted image to the device storage and triggers the device recovery. The device operating system will be reset to factory status but has <code>su</code> binary located in system executable directory, which means the user of the device could easily gain root privilege by installing a superuser management app or calling su command in the ADB shell. As the <em>Volez</em> does not follow any attack channel where we mentioned above, we classify it and any similar future exploits as others.</p>
<h3 id="P3-Expected-privilege"><a href="#P3-Expected-privilege" class="headerlink" title="(P3) Expected privilege"></a>(P3) Expected privilege</h3><p>Root privilege is the ultimate goal of privilege escalation on Android platform, however, sometimes it does not need to be mandatory as some functions like camera and screenshot do not require root privilege to invoke. Gaining code execution in Android <em>System Server</em> or <em>Media Server</em> could also be considered as a successful exploitation under certain circumstance (Davi et al., 2010). Many exploits can help attacker gain root privilege directly. Nevertheless, there are some exploits targeting high privileges other than root, for example, the system user privilege, the shell privilege, privileges within sub-systems of the target device like baseband or trusted executable environment (TEE), etc.</p>
<h2 id="Technical-Perspectives"><a href="#Technical-Perspectives" class="headerlink" title="Technical Perspectives"></a>Technical Perspectives</h2><h3 id="T1-Attack-surface"><a href="#T1-Attack-surface" class="headerlink" title="(T1) Attack surface"></a>(T1) Attack surface</h3><p>Attack surface represents a set of interactions and components where an exploit takes advantage and initiates the attack routine. By observing various exploits, we summarize attack surfaces used by these exploits, furthermore we categorize those attack surfaces into 3 groups - they are remote attack surfaces, local attack surfaces, and physical attack surfaces. The remote attack surfaces and local attack surfaces represent different approaches that the attacker uses to interact with the target device. On the other hand, the local attack surfaces contain the components within the Android operating system where the exploit takes advantage to escalate privilege. It is worth mentioning that an exploit may have multiple attack surfaces from different categories to constitute a successful attack.</p>
<h4 id="T1-1-Physical-Attack-Surface"><a href="#T1-1-Physical-Attack-Surface" class="headerlink" title="(T1.1) Physical Attack Surface"></a>(T1.1) Physical Attack Surface</h4><p>Establishing USB connection between the attack machine and the target device is the first step for many exploitations. USB is the primary wired interface for Android devices to interact with other devices. In an active Android operating system, there is a service named ADB daemon (“adb”) standing by all the time to facilitate the command operation and data transmission through ADB channel. Once a trusted ADB connection has been set up, the attacker can deploy an exploit by either executing corresponding commands to install a crafted application, or starting a shell session to run an executive file with attack payload. For that reason, USB is treated as the most ubiquitous physical attack surface exposed to diverse exploits on Android platform. In addition to the USB, there are some other physical connection methods applicable for some Android devices and theoretically feasible to be the attack surface of exploitation, for example, the SD Card and the HDMI connection. However, until the date of this paper being drafted, there is no publicly released exploit found to use any physical connection method other than USB.</p>
<h4 id="T1-2-Remote-Client-side-Attack-Surface"><a href="#T1-2-Remote-Client-side-Attack-Surface" class="headerlink" title="(T1.2) Remote (Client-side) Attack Surface"></a>(T1.2) Remote (Client-side) Attack Surface</h4><p>The remote attack is always a very popular and attractive topic because it gets rid of physical restriction. Rather than a physical connection, the attacker could execute the exploit program over a computer network.<br>The web browser application is one of the major attack surfaces in remote attacks. One possible attack could be exercised by Document Object Model (DOM) manipulation through JavaScript. The malicious script injected by the attacker could dynamically modify the structure and content of current web page once loaded by the browser. In fact, due to the rich functionality of the browser application, there are a lot of opportunities for the attacker to explore the local attack surfaces from it. Among the existing Android exploits we surveyed, <em>WebKit Use-After-Free</em> is a typical browser attack which inserts a script into the space that has just been freed, and hereby achieves privilege escalation. Then it creates a remote shell window to allow the attacker to remotely control the target device.<br>Besides the browser, many web-powered applications on Android platform also have very high possibilities to be chosen as the attack surface during remote attacks. Most of the applications that work based on Internet service are implemented by making use of standardized web service APIs and libraries, for example, the SSL/TLS authentication and the embedded browser engine called <em>WebViews</em>. The components using standard WebViews libraries and APIs will very possibly reveal the potential attack surfaces. For example, in 2015, an exploit called <em>StageFright</em> has been found to take advantage of media previewing library on some Android devices. It can gain control of the victim’s device through a reverse shell by sending a crafted media file which contains malicious payload and then being previewed within victim’s device. A web-powered mobile application is selected to be the attack surface during the demonstration of StageFright exploitation.<br>Electronic mail (E-mail) client application is another potential attack surface for the remote attack. As most of the mainstream E-mail service providers allow users to attach any type of file in their messages, the attacker could insert malicious script into a document or media file and send to the victim through an E-mail message, then deliver an attack to the browser or other vulnerable applications to the victim’s device.</p>
<h4 id="T1-3-Local-Attack-Surface"><a href="#T1-3-Local-Attack-Surface" class="headerlink" title="(T1.3) Local Attack Surface"></a>(T1.3) Local Attack Surface</h4><p><strong>(T1.3.1) File System</strong>. Local attack surfaces represent the attack point initiated by a program or script which is already executing on the victim’s device. For most of the exploits programs, the local attack surface is the first step and a necessity of actual vulnerability exploitation. Here we summarize 6 different common attack surfaces in this category.<br>Due to the Unix lineage of the Android system, the file system is one of the most frequently mentioned attack surfaces to conduct the local attack. The file system defines ownership and permission for each file entry. Attackers will have a chance to exercise exploitation if there is no sufficient restriction being enforced for the file permission assignment. One typical file system attack is taking advantage of inadequate security implementation in <code>init.rc</code> file to exercise a symbolic link attack (Drake et al., 2014). By changing <code>/data/local</code> folder permission to make it writable by the user and shell group, the user can reboot the device and then set the <code>ro.kernel.qemu</code> value to 1 in <code>local.prop</code> file. As the result, the user of device obtains the root privilege. We will discuss the real application of the exploitation targeting Android file system in next technical perspective T3.</p>
<p><strong>(T1.3.2) Daemons.</strong> ADB and Zygote are two daemons most prevalently exploited by attackers. When we initiate an ADB session on Android devices, the ADB daemon (<code>adbd</code> process) starts running as the root user and then drops its privilege to the shell user before it gets ready to be used. However, in old versions of Android up to 2.2, the ADB daemon does not implement an adequate check to the return value of the <code>setuid</code> call at the moment of dropping privilege from root to the shell user. Similarly, the Zygote daemon also gives root user privilege to all the processes forked from it, and then drops privilege once the user who forks process from it has been confirmed. Since both daemons are originated from root user, they become popular attack surfaces to exercise an exploitation for root access. We will explain more about this process later in daemon abusing attack vector.</p>
<p><strong>(T1.3.3) System Calls.</strong> System calls constitute an important type of attack surface in the Android system. An attack can exercise by making use of the vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel of the Android system, invoking system calls with malicious data or arguments and then tampering the system kernel to attain higher privilege. For example, <em>TowelRoot / futex exploit</em> is one of the best-known exploits in early versions of the Android operating system. It takes advantage of code defects in <code>relock</code> and <code>requeue</code> functions defined in <code>futex.c</code> in the Linux kernel source code. When attackers running the exploit program, those vulnerable functions will be called with malicious arguments and in an inappropriate manner. As a result, the <code>addr_limit</code> value of the current thread has been modified and the user privilege of the current thread has been escalated correspondingly. Another exploit <code>libperf_event</code> targets on the <code>perf_swevent_init</code> function in the Linux kernel. It passes a negative integer as an argument of <code>perf_swevent_init</code> function to crash the current thread and then achieves arbitrary code execution to attain privilege for the attacker.</p>
<p><strong>(T1.3.4) Drivers.</strong> In the Android platform, drivers usually represent a bundle of libraries or modules that bridge the gap between user applications and a hardware or native system service. In fact, there are lots of drivers existing in the operating system of an actual Android device. We group these drivers into 3 types on the basis of their functionalities.<br>The first type of driver is called standard drivers (more of Linux side), which are ported from the Linux kernel. This type of drivers usually serves as enablers of the basic hardware, such as Bluetooth and audio. The attacker can migrate a driver vulnerability or issue residing in the Linux system to the Android platform. For example, there is an exploit called <em>dirtyCow</em> which is essentially found on Linux platform but later proved that works on the Android operating system, too. It makes use of race conditioning vulnerability in <code>tty</code> (controlling terminal) driver, turns the read-only mapping of a file to writable status and finally gains privilege.<br>Another type of driver is Android specified drivers, which are implemented to support the exclusive functionalities of the Android system on the basis of the Linux kernel. Many features of the Android system such as the Anonymous Shared Memory (<code>ashmem</code>), binder, logger, and power management, are all enabled by Android specific drivers. Drivers belonging to this category can be treated as attack surface to conduct exploitation. For instance, a famous exploit during the early stage of the Android history called <em>KillingInTheNameOf</em> and its variant <em>psneuter</em> exploit are all using <code>ashmem</code> driver as the local attack surface.<br>Last but not the least, the vendor drivers also play a key role in the local attack surface family. Due to the uneven quality of the drivers’ implementation by diverse hardware vendors, the APIs offered by vendor drivers often bring defects and therefore are used by attackers to conduct exploitation. Based on our findings, the first exploit that uses vendor driver as the attack surface is named <em>levitator</em> and released in 2011 (Drake et al., 2014). It takes advantage of the defect in APIs offered by PowerVR SGX chipset driver to corrupt the kernel memory and gain privilege. From then on, the exploits using vendor drivers as the primary local attack surface emerged quickly and reserved a significant proportion among all exploits since 2013.</p>
<h3 id="T2-Attack-vector"><a href="#T2-Attack-vector" class="headerlink" title="(T2) Attack vector"></a>(T2) Attack vector</h3><p>Attack vector represents the concrete attack method used by an exploit program to gain privilege. The pair of attack vector and attack surface depicts an attack model of exploitation. For some complex exploits, there may be more than one attack vectors existing during different phases of an attack. We summarize the attack vectors for different exploits according to the taxonomy of attack surface we made.</p>
<h4 id="T2-1-Daemon-Abusing"><a href="#T2-1-Daemon-Abusing" class="headerlink" title="(T2.1) Daemon Abusing"></a>(T2.1) Daemon Abusing</h4><p>As we mentioned previously, the ADB daemon (<code>adbd</code>) in Android system is designed to drop its privilege from the root to shell before itself being presented for user interaction. But unfortunately, the ADB daemon does not properly check the return value of <code>setuid</code> function in Android versions prior to 2.3, which leaves a chance of gaining root privilege by interrupting the privilege dropping process to attackers. In 2010, Sebastian Kraphmer found there is a threshold value specifying the maximum number of co-existing ADB processes that the Android system could normally accomplish the privilege dropping action (Drake et al., 2014). Once the threshold value being reached, the newly initiated ADB processes are presented to the user with root privilege. This kind of attack was later used in Sebastian’s exploit named <em>RageAgainstTheCage</em>. Thereafter, abusing ADB has been mentioned again in 2012 in <em>Z2 exploit</em>. By making use of security issues in ADB backup function on some Sony Xperia devices, the exploit program creates a race condition and injects a privileged symbolic link into the system - by doing so the read-only system properties could be tampered and eventually the ADB will run as root user.<br>Abusing Zygote process is another example of daemon abusing on Android device. Zygote serves as the father process in the Android system, where all Android applications are started by being forked from the Zygote process. However, this forking procedure has similar privilege assigning routine with ADB daemon. When a new process is forked by Zygote, the Zygote by default gives the newly generated process with root privilege and then drops its privilege if the new process is initiated by the local user. Some exploits, such as <em>Zimperlich / zygote jailbreak</em> and <em>Zysploit</em>, make use of the similar defects in Zygote that the privilege lowering stage can be bypassed once the number of processes under one specific application user ID (UID) has reached its maximum value. As the result, the upcoming processes forked by Zygote under same application UID will run as root user.</p>
<h4 id="T2-2-File-Permission-and-Symbolic-Link-Attack"><a href="#T2-2-File-Permission-and-Symbolic-Link-Attack" class="headerlink" title="(T2.2) File Permission and Symbolic Link Attack"></a>(T2.2) File Permission and Symbolic Link Attack</h4><p>File permission and symbolic link (symlink) attacks have been used in many exploits in Android version up to 4.1. During the Android booting up, an init function will be called to execute the commands listed in <code>init.rc</code> script. The initialization commands contain a couple of folder creation (<code>mkdir</code>) actions, changing permission (<code>chmod</code>) actions and changing owner (<code>chown</code>) actions. Attackers usually look for security issues from this initialization procedure, and then create a symlink within the space where they are going to set with higher privilege. By doing this, attackers are able to make protected directories user-writable and then they can overwrite the <code>local.prop</code> file and set ADB user to root.<br>As most of these exploits make use of security issues in the third-party customized system image rather than stock Android, the file permission and symlink attack exploits are overall brand specific or device model specific, for example, the <em>TacoRoot</em> for HTC models, <em>TwerkMyMoto</em> for Motorola models and <em>NachoRoot</em> for Asus models. This type of attack vectors has been mitigated since Android version 4.2 as Android added extra security semantics in the execution of <code>init</code> script to prevent the permission and file system from being exploited.</p>
<h4 id="T2-3-Shared-Memory-Remapping"><a href="#T2-3-Shared-Memory-Remapping" class="headerlink" title="(T2.3) Shared Memory Remapping"></a>(T2.3) Shared Memory Remapping</h4><p>As mentioned earlier, Android has its own shared memory subsystem called <code>ashmem</code>. Android offers a number of richer and simpler APIs to programmers for performance improvement by enabling developers to utilize shared memory wisely. Android system allows any user to create and map a region in shared memory, and then execute read and write actions in a very efficient manner. Unfortunately, the <code>ashmem</code> might also be used by the attacker to map and tamper the protected contents. Taking the exploit <em>KillingInTheNameOf</em> as example, due to the fact that system does not properly restrict local user to access the system properties space in early versions of the Android operating system like 2.x, the attacker could re-map the space where <code>local.prop</code> is located, and thereby change the <code>ro.secure</code> property to make the ADB process bypass the privilege dropping operation in future booting.</p>
<h4 id="T2-4-Memory-Corruption"><a href="#T2-4-Memory-Corruption" class="headerlink" title="(T2.4) Memory Corruption"></a>(T2.4) Memory Corruption</h4><p>Memory corruption is the attack vector that is commonly adopted for exploiting kernel and driver vulnerabilities. It occupies larger proportion among all available attack vectors for exploitation on the Android platform, especially after carrying a large scale of bug fixing and greatly strengthening Android security mechanism of Google since past few years ago. Memory corruption is a broad concept that describes all the approaches to alter the normal execution of the target device by memory manipulation. Many typical memory corruption methods like stack overflow, integer overflow, dereference of the null pointer and format error, could be found in available Android exploits.<br>To conduct an attack, the attacker usually chooses a privileged process as the target and then carries out memory attack by all means to crash the target process. Once the memory manipulation has been successfully achieved, the attacker may have a chance to execute arbitrary code on behalf of the privileged process and thereby gain soft root on the target device. For example, the <em>Use-After-Free Remote Code Execution on Webkit</em> uses null point dereference as attack vector to exploit; <em>GingerBreak</em> crashes the <code>vold</code> daemon by feeding a negative integer to it to cause an integer overflow; and <em>zergRush</em> invokes a <code>libsysutils.so</code> function with the wrong number of arguments passing in, leading to a Return Oriented Programming (ROP) chain to obtain soft root.<br>As the memory corruption is possible to occur at the moment of every function invocation during the execution of Android native program, there is no lack of memory corruption in our exploit survey results. It is hard to prevent memory corruption completely when compared with other types of attack vectors.</p>
<h4 id="T2-5-Remote-Shell-Control"><a href="#T2-5-Remote-Shell-Control" class="headerlink" title="(T2.5) Remote Shell Control"></a>(T2.5) Remote Shell Control</h4><p>All the attack vectors we list in previous paragraphs are corresponding to local attack. In addition to local attack, the attacker also has to own an extra pair of attack vector and surface to conduct a remote attack. Setting up a remote shell control is the most commonly used attack vector to conduct a remote attack. A remote shell control is not initiated by the attacker but triggered by the user of the target device - usually in an unaware manner. To prepare a remote attack, the attacker needs to implement the payload code which is able to start an ADB shell through the reverse TCP or HTTP connection to the attacker’s machine, and then embed the code into the exploit program. Thereafter the attacker just needs to wait until the payload is triggered, followed by a reverse shell launched by the target device.<br>Gaining remote shell control does not bring the attacker with a root superior privilege. However, it links a remote circumstance up with local attack methods and thereby makes exploitation without physical connection possible. In our survey, we can find the presence of remote shell control in all remote exploits, for example, the <em>Use-After-Free Remote Code Execution on Webkit</em> and <em>StageFright</em>.</p>
<h4 id="T2-6-Others"><a href="#T2-6-Others" class="headerlink" title="(T2.6) Others"></a>(T2.6) Others</h4><p>Among the exploits we found during this survey, there are some outdated, unrepresentative or undisclosed attack vectors. For example, an exploit named <em>StumpRoot</em> doesn’t provide any disclosure of technical details or source code to the public. The attack vector used by exploit <em>Volez</em> is outdated and unrepresentative when compared with other ones. In this paper, we classify those uncommon and unknown attack vectors as others.</p>
<h3 id="T3-Vulnerable-target"><a href="#T3-Vulnerable-target" class="headerlink" title="(T3) Vulnerable target"></a>(T3) Vulnerable target</h3><p>Vulnerable target describes the source of vulnerability where the attacker targets. An exploit could only be designed and implemented once the vulnerable target is confirmed. The mitigations of Android exploits are tailored to the vulnerable target correspondingly. In this paper, we present 5 different types of vulnerable targets to cover the existing cases of Android exploitation.</p>
<h4 id="T3-1-File-System"><a href="#T3-1-File-System" class="headerlink" title="(T3.1) File System"></a>(T3.1) File System</h4><p>The file system as a type of vulnerable target, is the most common focus of the file permission and symbolic link attack (refer to the technical perspective T2-2). All Android exploits targeting file system are achieved by conducting file permission and symbolic link attack. The ultimate goal of an exploit targeting Android file system is to change the ownership of file for either content tampering or illegal execution. For example, changing the value of <code>ro.kernel.qemu</code> to 1 in the <code>local.prop</code> file.<br>Most of the vulnerabilities relating to this type of Android exploit are caused by the vendors’ customization in Android, therefore the exploit attacking Android file system usually varies with devices’ manufacturer and hardware configuration. The file system exploits used to be a common type of exploits on Android platform until the Android version 4.2 when the <code>O_NOFOLLOW</code> semantics has been introduced to prevent the symbolic link attack (Google, 2017e). Since version 4.3, Android enforces the SELinux model to regulate all permission involved activities within Android system.</p>
<h4 id="T3-2-System-Component"><a href="#T3-2-System-Component" class="headerlink" title="(T3.2) System Component"></a>(T3.2) System Component</h4><p>We group all the Google-implemented components located in middleware layer, framework layer and application layer of Android architecture as system components. We use the term system exploits to represent exploits targeting vulnerabilities from system components. The Android components which provide either interface to native level development or user space access are often exploited by attackers. For example, the system services, native libraries, daemons, and Android shared memory (<code>ashmem</code>). The first ever publicly released exploit program on Android platform is a system exploit called <em>Volez</em>, which manipulates the system recovery service to place superuser binary into the system executable directory on victim’s device. There are some other milestones where exploits are categorized as system exploits, such as the <em>KillingInTheNameOf</em> that takes advantage of ashmem access issue to gain root access, the <em>RageAgainstTheCage</em> that targets vulnerabilities in Android <em>adbd</em> daemon to achieve privilege escalation; and the <em>StageFright</em> that can exploit the library with the same name in Android system to obtain high privilege in silence.<br>Compared with other 4 groups of vulnerable targets, the system components’ vulnerabilities are relatively easier to be fixed by Android. The mitigation of system exploits usually comes with a timely Android security patch or an operating system update.</p>
<h4 id="T3-3-Linux-Kernel"><a href="#T3-3-Linux-Kernel" class="headerlink" title="(T3.3) Linux Kernel"></a>(T3.3) Linux Kernel</h4><p>We use Linux kernel to represent those vulnerable targets located in kernel layer components other than the file system, which includes Linux kernel drivers, process manager, and network controller. Unlike the Android system vulnerabilities, Linux kernel vulnerabilities are mostly found from the source code of the Linux kernel rather than Google’s implementation in Android. Therefore, many vulnerable targets that exploit other operating systems in Linux family can also be migrated to Android platform. The exploitation targeting Linux kernel on Android platform has been firstly introduced in an exploit program named <em>exploid</em> in 2010. The <em>exploid</em> selects <code>init</code> daemon in Linux kernel as the target, exploits a vulnerability by initiating memory corruption and gains root privilege from the daemon.<br>Because the root user is designed as a part of privilege architecture in the Linux kernel, it is difficult for the components running on the Android platform to prevent privilege escalation initiated from the kernel exploits. Furthermore, due to the fact that the evolution of Linux kernel is usually slower than the evolution of Android, it makes it harder in Android to identify and fix kernel vulnerabilities within a short period. As a consequence, the Linux Kernel exploit usually works on multiple continuous version of Android systems.</p>
<h4 id="T3-4-Vendor-Driver"><a href="#T3-4-Vendor-Driver" class="headerlink" title="(T3.4) Vendor Driver"></a>(T3.4) Vendor Driver</h4><p>The exploits in this category target hardware abstraction layer (HAL) implementation. The history of vendor driver exploits could be dated back to 2010. <em>levitator</em> is the first Android exploit that conducts an attack on devices with specific hardware configuration containing PowerVR SGX chipset. As the Android experienced a rapid growth in the past few years, the great flexibility and diversity in hardware configuration on Android platform makes vendor driver exploits one of the major type of the exploitation.<br>Vendor driver exploits exclusively have 2 advantages. Firstly, compared with TEE exploits, vendor driver exploits can escalate privilege to system or root level and return to the user control directly; meanwhile, unlike the kernel exploits or system exploits, vendor driver exploits make use of vulnerabilities caused by the add-ons from various vendors rather than Android implementation, which means Android cannot exhaustively and effectively fix all the issues via its version update and hence may not be able to prevent from any induced exploitation in short time. Therefore, for the foreseeable future, we believe that the vendor driver exploits will still be the majority of new exploits.</p>
<h4 id="T3-5-Trusted-Execution-Environment"><a href="#T3-5-Trusted-Execution-Environment" class="headerlink" title="(T3.5) Trusted Execution Environment"></a>(T3.5) Trusted Execution Environment</h4><p>Attacking trusted execution environment (TEE) is a novel attempt at privilege escalation. In 2015, a researcher called laginimaineb published a series of blog articles and the proof-of-concept source code to explain his idea to gain TEE level privilege from <em>Qualcomm TrustZone</em>, which marks the first time that the TEE was exploited (laginimaineb, 2015).<br>Compared with exploits targeting other types of vulnerable targets, the TEE exploits have a very strict requirement but low practicability. Sometimes TEE exploits require a device flashed with customized ROM or that has Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) disabled. However, the outcome of a successful exploitation is just the privilege within TEEOS module rather than the root user. The attacker may not be able to attain full control of the victim device, instead, the attacker could gain access to the credential data like fingerprint or iris image, which is very sensitive as well. Currently TEE exploits are still in the theoretical stage, however, it is an inspiration to the future exploitation when security mechanism of the Android system become too strong to obtain root directly.</p>
<h1 id="Survey"><a href="#Survey" class="headerlink" title="Survey"></a>Survey</h1><p>We conduct a survey of publicly released Android exploits from multiple sources and we find 63 exploits covering all Android versions up to 7.0. By reading their descriptions, searching for available source codes and studying correspond- ing vulnerabilities, we collect rich details of these 63 exploits. In this study, we summarize all the key details that are useful for upcoming analysis, and we organize them into a table. The table below shows the complete collection of all 63 exploits including their names, authors, release years, attack details, details of corresponding recorded vulnerabilities, affected devices &amp; Android versions and our evaluation outcome. In order to distinguish an exploit from the others and facilitate our analysis, we focus on practical and technical perspectives of Android exploitation and we select 3 classification criteria from the taxonomy we proposed in the previous section. In the remaining contents of this section, we present our classification based on these 3 selected criteria and then we discuss our observation on each of them. </p>

<h1 id="Classification"><a href="#Classification" class="headerlink" title="Classification "></a>Classification </h1><h2 id="Execution-Channel"><a href="#Execution-Channel" class="headerlink" title="Execution Channel"></a>Execution Channel</h2><p>We find all three kinds of execution channels from the 62 exploits except <em>Volez</em>. For convenience, we call those exploits using app execution channel as “app exploits”, those exploits triggered by shell scripts through the physical connection as “shell exploits”, and those exploits executed by embedded payload code via remote environment will be notated as “remote exploits”. Figure below demonstrates the distribution of exploits according to execution channels.</p>
<p><strong>App Exploit.</strong> There are 19 exploits coming with a standalone APK file, reserving 30.6% among all exploits in our collection. All those exploits, except <em>GingerBreak</em> and <em>TowelRoot</em>, could only work on devices in a specific hardware configuration or in some exact models. The <em>GingerBreak</em> takes advantage of vulnerabilities in <code>vold</code> daemon and has been fixed in updates of Android version 2.3.4 and 3.0 in 2011, which are considered as a pretty early stage of Android history. Another exploit named <em>TowelRoot</em> used to be popular due to its long list of supporting device; however, its functionality to successfully gain root privilege stops at Android version 4.4.4, which is another outdated system nowadays (Wikipedia, 2017b). Therefore, we can optimistically conclude that most of the Android devices in the market are safe against existing APK exploits.</p>
<p><strong>Shell Exploit.</strong> Shell exploits take the majority of our collection according to the figure below. We totally collect 37 shell exploits in this survey, which comprise over 59% of the entire collection. Among these 37 shell exploits, three exploits (<em>Defy republic init_runit</em>, <em>TwerkMyMoto</em> and <em>Pie / vold asec</em>) come with Java source codes that the attacker has to compile and compress them into an executable JAR file to conduct the exploitation; three exploits targeting the file system (<em>TacoRoot</em>, <em>NachoRoot</em> and <em>TPSparklyRoot</em>) are provided with an ADB shell script rather than executable binaries; and the 31 exploits left are all C codes which the attacker needs to configure the project with specified hardware architecture (e.g. arm64 or x86)(Wikipedia, 2017a) and build with Android Native Development Kit (NDK) to generate executable binaries. According to the information listed in the table above, those 37 exploits cover all Android system versions up to 6.0 and most of the mainstream device models. Therefore in the case of all three pre-requisites (refer to P1), practical perspective P2) of shell execution have been compromised to the attacker, an Android device will have a great probability to be successfully exploited if those shell exploits have been put into a proper combination and executed.</p>

<p><strong>Remote Exploit.</strong> Other than local USB connection, ADB also provides developers with access to an unprivileged interaction through a remote shell. In our collection, 9.7% of exploits are classified as remote exploits. There are two exploits targeting the Android Stagefright library vulnerabilities, three exploits targeting the Android Webkit library vulnerabilities, and one exploit attaining root privilege by taking advantage of a Linux kernel vulnerability. Taking <em>StageFright Remote Code Execution</em> (hereafter refer to <em>StageFright</em> for short) as an example, it is a typical remote exploit that the attacker can gain root privilege of the target device by hosting a crafted web page containing media payload source code. The exploit will be triggered automatically and executed once the user starts browsing the crafted web page, and in the end, the exploit will initiate a remote shell process to the attack machine to pass the control of the target device to the attacker.</p>
<div align="center"><br><div style="width:90%;margin-top:-30px;"><br><img src="/2018/07/01/exploit-survey/exploit_vector_growth_w_legend.png"><br>Growth of Exploits (Per Attack Vector)<br></div></div>

<h2 id="Attack-Vector"><a href="#Attack-Vector" class="headerlink" title="Attack Vector"></a>Attack Vector</h2><p>Classification by attack vector provides an intuitive perception to the methodology of Android exploitation. Based on our taxonomy, we summarize attack vectors into 6 different categories. We demonstrate the growth of exploits in different attack modes throughout the history of Android system in the figure above.<br><strong>Daemon Abusing Exploit.</strong> In this survey, we find four exploits that gain privilege by abusing daemons running on the Android system. Among the four daemon abusing exploits, the <em>RageAgainstTheCage</em> and <em>Z2 Root exploit</em> exhaust the ADB daemon (“adbd”) to interrupt the privilege dropping procedure of all future generated ADB sessions; the other two exploits - <em>Zimperlich / zygote jailbreak</em> and <em>Zysploit</em> impose similar routine to the Zygote daemon as the Zygote daemon also has privilege lowering mechanism while generating new process. The issues of these two daemons have been progressively fixed since the Android system version 2.3 was released at the end of 2010. According to our observation, the growth of this kind of attack has not appeared anymore in 2012 and afterward.<br><strong>File Permission &amp; Symbolic Link Exploit.</strong> File permission and symbolic link attacks are also known as <em>permission attack</em> or <em>symlink attack</em> elsewhere. There are 8 exploits gaining root privilege by initiating a permission attack. Except for the <em>mempodroid / mempodipper exploit</em> that makes use of a loophole from the Android file permission to directly modify process memory file, all the remaining 6 exploits take advantage of poor security mechanism in critical directories or files, create a symbolic link to either “local.prop” or “uevent_helper” and then tamper the privilege assignment of the ADB shell service. As a result, a successful exploit will return user an ADB session running as root user. The permission mechanism on Android file system is mature, safe and well organized. However, the attacker could still find a flaw to exercise attack due to the negligence or defect within the implementation of Android device manufacturer. Owing to the improvement of Android security mechanism and enhancement in security awareness from the device vendors, it is rare to see new file permission and symbolic link attack in recent years.<br><strong>Shared Memory Exploit.</strong> Similar to daemons’ abusing, shared memory remapping is another common approach to gain privilege in early versions of the Android system. We find two exploits that gain privilege by attacking the Android shared memory (<code>ashmem</code>)<br>– <em>KillingInTheNameOf</em> and <em>psneuter ashmem exploit</em>. Both of them achieve privilege escalation by remapping the shared memory region and tampering the value of user ID assigned to ADB console. The ashmem vulnerability could be fixed by adding a number of authentication checks at the moment that the shared memory is accessed by any app or process from user space. In fact, the relevant ashmem vulnerability has been fixed in very short time. The number of shared memory attack cease to grow since 2011.<br><strong>Memory Corruption Exploit.</strong> Memory corruption is the major attack vector throughout the history of the Android exploitation. Memory corruption exploits reserve over the half of all available exploits since the very beginning phase of the Android exploitation. Moreover, the memory corruption even becomes the only feasible local attack vector to gain privilege in 2015 and 2016. It is also worth noting that besides the quantitative growth, the diversity of memory corruption methods has been greatly enriched as well. During the early years, the memory corruption technique only covered format error (e.g. <em>exploid</em>) and null pointer dereference (e.g. <em>Use-After-Free Webkit</em>). But now, the memory corruption exploitation on the Android platform almost covers all the memory manipulation on conventional platforms, such as return-oriented programming. As it is impossible to completely prevent memory corruption in native level development for Android platform, we believe that memory corruption exploits will continue to play the primary role within Android exploit family in future.<br><strong>Remote Shell Control Exploit.</strong> Compared with other attack modes, remote shell control usually requires the user of the target device, on purpose or unknowingly, to trigger the attack process. Conducting remote shell control attack could indirectly create an interface for the attacker and convert a remote attack to a local attack for further privilege escalation. For that reason, the remote shell control is usually executed together with a certain local attack vector to complete the privilege escalation operation for the attacker in distance. Remote shell control attack has a great advantage in camouflage and anonymity, which are two important features of a good exploitation. In this survey, we find 6 exploits that make use of this attack vector to achieve remote attack throughout the history of Android exploits. As mentioned earlier in practical perspective P2, a successful remote shell control exploits requires the attacker to be under the same network with the victim’s device and moreover to know the IP address of the victim’s device prior to generating exploitation payload. Due to those reasons, even the growth of remote shell control exploits has never ceased since they were firstly introduced in 2010, the complicated execution procedure and strict conditions make the remote shell control still not yet a mainstream attack vector when compared with memory corruption.</p>

<h2 id="Vulnerable-Target"><a href="#Vulnerable-Target" class="headerlink" title="Vulnerable Target"></a>Vulnerable Target</h2><p>Classification by vulnerable target could tell us where the exploitation originates. Moreover, we can gain an insight of the Android exploits in defense perspective by grouping the exploits by their vulnerable targets and analyzing the quantitative trend throughout the history of the Android system. According to the taxonomy in the previous section, we differentiate the vulnerable targets of all exploits into five groups of components within software part of the Android device. We depict the quantitative trends of exploits with different vulnerable targets in the figure above.<br><strong>File System Exploit.</strong> We find six cases of file system exploitation among 63 Android exploits, and all six file system exploits use file permission &amp; symbolic link attack to gain privilege. By analyzing each of those 6 exploits, we notice that the device manufacturers’ implementation is the root cause of the exploitation. We find that all of them are applicable to a small range of device models under the same brand, and the places where exploitation takes place are either the initialization scripts or the privileged factory software (e.g. backup &amp; restore app). The history of file system exploits starts in 2011 when an exploit for some specific HTC models named “<em>TacoRoot</em>“ has been released. In early 2012, the author of <em>TacoRoot</em>, Justin Case, released a variant called <em>NachoRoot</em>, which uses similar attack but is designed for a different set of device models. Shortly after that, another similar exploit <em>TPSparkyRoot</em> also has been published within the same forum, targeting same devices as <em>NachoRoot</em>. The other three exploits, <em>LG Sprite software backup / LGPwn exploit</em>, <em>TwerkMyMoto</em> and <em>WeakSauce</em>, have subsequently been released between 2013 and 2014 by Justin Case. At the same time, both Google and device manufacturers have greatly improved the security mechanism of Android devices. As the result, new file system exploits have ceased to appear since 2015.<br><strong>System Component Exploit.</strong> System implementation is the second largest exploit target. There are a total of 16 system exploits released in the Android history, reserving over 25% among all surveyed Android exploits. Except for <em>Volez</em> which targets system recovery service and is counted as a special case for the early Android versions, all the remaining 15 system exploits are targeting native libraries, daemons or ashmem. Two exploits, <em>KillingInTheNameOf</em> and <em>psneuert</em>, take advantage of ashmem access issue and were published in 2011. Six exploits use daemons as their targets. The daemons which have been abused for exploitation include <code>vold</code>, <code>zygote</code> and <code>adbd</code>. Furthermore, there are seven exploits that conduct attacks by invoking system calls to specific libraries. The targeted vulnerable libraries include <em>Webkit</em>, <em>libsysutils</em>, <em>StageFright</em> and media server libraries.<br>It is noticeable to mention that the ashmem exploits only appear in the new exploit list of 2011 due to the quick fix. Considering the limited number of daemons that are accessible by user space processes, the growth of exploits caused by daemon abusing was suspended in 2014. Starting from 2015, all newly released system exploits are achieved by memory corruption against native libraries. There are a large number of libraries in the Android system implementation and each of them provides unique functionality and interface. Compared with ashmem exploits and daemon exploits which target only one or a few number of vulnerabilities, protecting the libraries from memory corruption attack is a more challenging work for Android.<br><strong>Linux Kernel Exploit.</strong> Starting from the first Linux kernel exploit “<em>exploid</em>“ which is released in 2010, the number of Linux kernel exploits (hereafter referred to as kernel exploits for short) keeps growing every year. In this survey, we collect 11 kernel exploits with their release date spanning from 2010 to 2016. From the static analysis made on those 11 exploits, we find there is only one kernel exploit called <em>prctl_vma_exploit</em> (2016) that is exclusive to the Android platform. All the other 10 kernel exploits are created as variants and share same vulnerabilities and attack routines with corresponding exploits for Linux operating system. Moreover, our analysis shows that kernel libraries and driver interfaces are the most frequently chosen vulnerable targets by Linux kernel exploits. Attackers often make use of flaws in input validation to create memory corruption while invoking kernel services. We also find that many Android exploits with long life cycle and wide support to different devices are kernel exploits. For example, the <em>TowelRoot</em> declares to be able to root all devices installed with Android version up to 4.4; and <em>PingPongRoot</em> could easily root over 100 models of latest device models at that time like Samsung S6 / S6 Edge and HTC One.<br><strong>Vendor Driver Exploit.</strong> There are 25 vendor driver exploits being included in our survey. We find that all vendor driver exploits are achieved by memory corruption except for the <em>StumpRoot</em> exploit (2013) which does not have enough details disclosed. In addition, we also find that vendor driver exploits usually come in a group to achieve the maximum effort and compatibility. For example, in 2012, an exploit making use of Samsung driver has been published by “alephzain”. It is essentially named <em>Exynos Abuse</em> but later changed to <em>Sam exploit</em> when it is merged with some other vendor driver exploits written by the same author in 2013. The new bundle of various vendor driver exploits has been published as a one-click app on XDA forum with the name “<em>framaroot</em>“. According to author’s statement, the <em>framaroot</em> has integrated 12 different vendor driver exploits by 2014, covering over 450 device models from multiple brands (Alephzain, 2013).<br><strong>Trusted Execution Environment Exploit.</strong> We find five TEE exploits during this survey. There are four of “laginimaineb” <em>Qualcomm TrustZone</em> exploits and 1 Huawei TEE exploit named <em>Mate7 TrustZone exploit</em> in our survey collection. By reading the authors’ instructions of those exploits and analyzing their source code, we find that all of them can only achieve limited code execution with specific TEE level privilege, rather than flashing superuser binary or returning a root shell to the attacker. Therefore, in the current stage, TEE exploits still have obvious disadvantage in practicability and convenience when compared with others.</p>
<p><strong><em>As we mentioned in our taxonomy, we define those exploits with outdated, unrepresentative or undisclosed attack vectors as others. We do not consider exploits from this category in upcoming discussion due to their uncommonness.</em></strong></p>
