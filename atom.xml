    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div align="center" style="padding-bottom:15px;" width="100"><img src="/2018/08/21/analysing-high-privileges/android.jpg"></div><p>The number of Android smartphone and tablet users has experienced a rapid growth in the past few years and it raises users’ awareness on the privacy and security of their mobile devices. The features of openness and extensibility make Android unique, attractive and competitive but meanwhile vulnerable to malicious attack. There are lots of users rooting their Android devices for some useful functions, which are not originally provided to developers and users, such as backup and taking screenshot. However, after observing the danger of rooting devices, the developers begin to look for other non-root alternatives to implement those functions. <a id="more"></a> ADB workaround is one of the best known non-root alternatives to help app gain higher privilege on Android. It used to be considered as a secure practice until some cases of ADB privilege leakage have been found.In this project, we design an approach and implement a couple of tools to detect the privilege leakage in Android apps. We apply them to analyse three real-world apps with millions of users, and successfully identify three ADB privilege leaks from them. Moreover, we also conduct an exploitation of the ADB privilege in one app, and therefore we prove the existence of vulnerabilities in ADB workaround. Based on out study, we propose some suggestion to help developers create their apps that could not only satisfy users’ needs but also protect users’ privacy from similar attacks in future.</p><h1 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h1><p>The rise of mobile devices has greatly enriched people’s lives in this digital era. As the dominator of current mobile device market, Android reserves over 82.8% of the entire smartphone market share [13]. Andy Rubin, the VP of Google stated on his twitter that the number of Android devices activated per day has reach 1.3 millions in past few years [21]. The global gross shipments of Android devices is expected to grow from 1.2 billion in 2015 to 1.54 billions in 2019 [12]. The over-reliance on mobile devices makes people save all the data regardless of personal or business purpose onto their smartphone or tablet, which may lead their privacy under exposure if no proper protection has been enforced.</p><p>Android is well-known by its rich functionality and customisation, but there are still some requirements which cannot be implemented by using the official APIs. Google creates a collection of permission labels to define the privilege of apps running on Android OS. Some actions like reading the content displaying on the screen, in another word taking screenshot, was marked as <em>signature level</em> permission, hence are not allowed to be realised by the third party application. As long as the requirement of users exists, the developers would never stop to push the boundary. For that reason, developers are all motivated and successfully come up with two approaches to solve the permission dilemma, namely “rooting the phone” and “ADB workaround”.</p><p>Rooting the devices could enable users to gain the administration privileges to do anything they want such as removing pre-installed apps, unlocking more functionalities, or sometimes just simply changing the theme of UI. According to a statistic done by Kristijan Lucic in 2014 [15], there are over 27.44% users indicating that they have rooted their smartphones to remove redundant and useless pre-installed applications. However, there are several security issues behind the “rooting” because it disables the permission mechanism on Android system. </p><p>The good news says there is an increasing number of people who have realised the risk and danger of rooting their devices, and has started seeking non-root approaches. Gaining system privilege through <em>Android Debug Bridge (ADB)</em> is one of the best known and widely used workarounds. Users can connect their devices to a PC via either USB or wireless network, launch the ADB and then invoke a service with system level privilege running in the background. After that, an application could communicate with that service, send command to it, and thereby trigger it to work for the application with system privilege. In this manner, that app can do the job even without APIs provided by Android, any time and anywhere unless being powered off.</p><p>There are plenty of apps on Google Play Store adopting this ADB workaround to satisfy users’ specific needs which are not provided with APIs by Android OS, including, but not limited to, performing backup and restoration, taking screenshot, recording screen, etc. Those apps using ADB workaround to achieve high privilege are very popular and some of them has millions users.</p><p>The security of ADB workaround has been raised up after some exploitation being successfully conducted. It is critical because it refers to the privacy of millions of Android users. In this project, we design an approach to discover the vulnerabilities of ADB workaround and implement a solution to detect the privilege leakage. We apply this approach to three real-world apps downloaded from Google Play Store, analyse them and eventually discover the privilege leakage on each of three apps by using the tool we implemented. In addition, we conduct an exploitation on one of these three apps named “No Root Screenshot It” and successfully prove the existence of vulnerabilities that we have recently found. Last but not least, we provide some advice to the developers to help them achieve users’ requirement and meanwhile protect users’ data and privacy. </p><h1 id="Background"><a href="#Background" class="headerlink" title="Background"></a>Background</h1><h2 id="Privilege-amp-Permission-on-Android"><a href="#Privilege-amp-Permission-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="Privilege &amp; Permission on Android"></a>Privilege &amp; Permission on Android</h2><p>Privilege is a security attribute required for certain operations. In Unix-like operation system, the process privileges are organised in shape of a flat tree, where the users’ privilege is presented as the leaves and the superuser is described as root [17]. Android, as a mobile operation system built based on Unix/Linux, takes advantage of the user-based protection to identify and isolate the resources used by applications. All applications on Android run within the <em>application sandbox</em> and only have limited permissions to access resources which have declared in advance [8].</p><p>Similar to other Unix-like operating systems, Android also has the <em>superuser-level</em> privilege called <em>root</em> that has full access to all apps’ data. By default, only a small subset of the core applications run with system or signature permissions, and most of the apps downloaded from the Google Play Store only request the user-level permissions such as access to the Internet, hardware sensor and camera. Android OS does not prevent users or applications with the root permission from accessing and even modifying the other applications even it is not encouraged [8].</p><p>Besides employing underlying Unix-like privilege system, Android alsohas its own privilege management mechanism, which is also known aspermission levels. On Android platform, permissions are classified intoseveral protection levels. Most of the Android developers are madeavailable to either the “<em>normal</em>” level permissions or the“<em>dangerous</em>” level permissions in their development. The <em>normal</em> levelpermissions, such as Internet, vibration, NFC or setting alarm, areconsidered as having no great risk to the user’s privacy or security.Those permissions will not prompt the user to grant permission ifproperly declared in manifest during the development. The <em>dangerous</em>level permissions indicate that the application needs access to privatedata or control over the device that may potentially have a negativeimpact to user. Unlike the <em>normal</em> level, all the operations classifiedin <em>dangerous</em> level will not be executed until obtaining user consent.In addition to <em>normal</em> level and <em>dangerous</em> level, there are two moreprotection levels namely <em>signature</em> level and <em>signature or system</em>level defining risky permissions. The former is only granted to theapplications signed by a trusted party like Android development group.The latter could only be granted to the apps that are embedded inAndroid system image or signed by vendors of the system image [6]. The grant of these two permission levels is not to beapproved by users, instead, it is conducted by signature validationmechanism of Andorid system during installation [22]. Manyfunctions that users require but not provided as public APIs by AndroidOS, like backing up, taking screenshot and screen recording, belong tothe <em>signature</em> level permission.</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Permission</strong></th><th><strong>Description</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>CALL_PRIVILEGED</code></td><td>Initiate a call without user confirmation</td></tr><tr><td><code>CAPTURE_VIDEO_OUTPUT</code></td><td>Capture video output stream</td></tr><tr><td><code>DELETE_CACHE_FILES</code></td><td>Delete cache files</td></tr><tr><td><code>DELETE_PACKAGE</code></td><td>Uninstall package</td></tr><tr><td><code>INSTALL_PACKAGES</code></td><td>Install packages</td></tr><tr><td><code>READ_FRAME_BUFFER</code></td><td>Access to the frame buffer data (e.g. screenshot)</td></tr><tr><td><code>READ_LOGS</code></td><td>Read system log files</td></tr><tr><td><code>REBOOT</code></td><td>Reboot the system</td></tr><tr><td><code>SET_TIME</code></td><td>Set system time</td></tr><tr><td><code>WRITE_APN_SETTINGS</code></td><td>Overwrite APN setting</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Examples of <em>signature</em>-level Permissions Not Granted to the Third|</p><h2 id="Privilege-Escalation"><a href="#Privilege-Escalation" class="headerlink" title="Privilege Escalation "></a>Privilege Escalation </h2><p>In order to implement the function like backup, taking screenshot or screen recording, developers have to find a way to escalate the privilege of their apps to the signature level or higher. There are two privilege escalation approaches on Android, namely rooting and non-root workarounds.  </p><h3 id="Rooting"><a href="#Rooting" class="headerlink" title="Rooting"></a>Rooting</h3><p>The word “root” may not be a strange term to an Android player. Rooting is the process of allowing users of Android devices to attain privileged control, which is also known as the root access [25]. The rooting process grants users with <em>superuser</em> level permissions to use their devices, which could provide users a ton of customizations and opportunities to exhaust the functionality of Android OS. However, besides the risks of voiding warranty and bricking the devices, rooting an Android device could also expose all the data and program to the adversary and bring severe security vulnerabilities [18]. The rooting process varies with hardware manufacture and system version, but generally speaking, there are three steps to root an Android device, including unlocking Bootloader, flashing custom Recovery ROM, and lastly, installing <em>SuperSU</em> [2]. Once an Android device is rooted, users can access and modify the system resource. Furthermore, user can customize privilege and assign to any application installed on the rooted device. </p><h3 id="Non-root-Alternative"><a href="#Non-root-Alternative" class="headerlink" title="Non-root Alternative"></a>Non-root Alternative</h3><p>Rooting Android device is a risky practice because it may void the warranty, brick the device and bring with numerous security vulnerabilities. Therefore, developers start to seek non-root alternatives to escalate privilege. There is an alternative approach called <em>ADB workaround</em> to attain high level privilege without rooting the device, and it becomes popular whilst the growth of users’ concern to their device security.</p><p>Take the programmatic screenshot as an example. An app needs to have a signature-level permission from the system to take screenshot, which is impossible for normal developers to obtain through normal level permission request in interface. However, there are still two workarounds even without the concession from Android development team: (1) taking screenshot on rooted devices; or (2) making use of a process with higher privilege to escalate the privilege of the app. The latter approach does not require the holistic change to the Android devices like “rooting”, and has better security and reliability [14].</p><p>ADB is a development tool provided by Google to allow developers to debug apps <em>shell</em> in the Android devices from their PCs. A process requiring signature-level permissions, such as taking screenshot or backup, is not allowed to be implemented in app by third party developers, but could be started from a ADB shell window [14]. That is the reason why ADB workaround could achieve higher privilege. Using ADB workaround, developers could implement all methods requiring signature-level permissions, pack all of them into a executive that could be started on ADB and run them in the background of Android OS as a service until being killed (e.g. power-off, restart). Thus the unprivileged App could communicate with the privileged proxy to indirectly achieve the functionality that may not able to be done on unprivileged App only.</p><h2 id="Reverse-Engineering-on-Android"><a href="#Reverse-Engineering-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="Reverse Engineering on Android"></a>Reverse Engineering on Android</h2><p>Reverse engineering, also known as back engineering, is defined by Wikipedia as “<em>the term describing processes of extracting knowledge or design information from an existing product and reproducing based on the extracted knowledge or design information with personal modification</em>” [24].</p><p>The Apps on Android are mainly written in Java and HTML5/CSS, packaged in format of APK and executed on the virtual machine called <em>Dalvik (DVM)</em>. Unlike Java Virtual Machine (JVM), the DVM uses a single Dalvik executive (DEX) file with different data structures and opcodes rather than a jar file compressing multiple Java classes together. Besides that, the JVM is a stack-based machine but DVM is designed as a register-based machine. For those reasons, the decompilation and reverse engineering on Android are more complicated and more challenging than doing the same things on Java code [16].</p><p>There are some tools designed for easy decompilation of Android Apps being made available to the public for free. For example, <em>Apktool</em> [a] is a very useful tool providing smali assembler and disassembler for APK files, thereby facilitate to modify an app and repackage it [5]. Another tool called <em>dex2jar</em> [b] allows users to convert APK back into a jar file, which could be easily further into Java codes by using Java decompiler such as <em>JD-GUI</em> [c] [16].</p><p>Most developers do not want the reverse engineering happened onto their products. Techniques like obfuscation could help developers to make the code unreadable before it being released to the market to prevent reverse engineering. A tool named <em>ProGuard</em> has been integrated into the Android build system by Google to help users shrinks, optimizes, and obfuscates the code [7]. Another tool <em>DexGuard</em>, which is a premium version of ProGuard, are widely used by commercial organisations and enterprises because it offers more advanced features to protect Android Apps from both static and dynamic analysis [9]. </p><h2 id="Instrumentation"><a href="#Instrumentation" class="headerlink" title="Instrumentation"></a>Instrumentation</h2><p>There are two famous alternatives of frameworks that achieve hooking on Andorid. One of them is an open-source frameworks called <em>Xposed</em> [d]. Another well-known framework is <em>Substrate</em> [e] which is not open-sourced but has better documented API. Both of them have similar functions and work based on a similar mechanism as well [3]. Xposed is more prevalent in the research field and developers community. There are over 800 modules implemented based on Xposed framework available to the public for free on Xposed Module Repository [19]. </p><p>The core of Android runtime is the process called <em>Zygote</em>. Each application is executed in form of a copy of Zygote, which is also known as “fork”. When an Android device is booted, a script named “<code>init.rc</code>” is started, followed by loading all necessary classes and methods by “<code>/system/bin/app_process</code>”. When Xposed comes into play, an extended startup app_process is copied to the “<code>/system/bin</code>” and then be started during the booting. In this way, Xposed can inject that extended startup process into the DVM instance, before each <code>main</code> method being called and invoked. Xposed provides a private and native method named <code>hookMethodNative</code> which is implemented within extended app_process. It could change the method type to “native”, and then onload its own implementation to that “native” method. Each method being hooked by Xposed will be converted into a “native” one, and the actual method being called could be treated as a brand new method with original implementation and overrided hook handling code written by Xposed framework developer [20]. </p><p>Hooking usually happened before or after the execution of target methods. A hook module could not only record and log all the data sending in and passing out the target methods, but also alter the behaviour of target methods by modifying its parameters or return value [11]. Therefore a dynamic analysis by Xposed hooking could help us to sketch out the data flow of a program. Figure below shows an example of hooking process onto an imaginary screenshot app. Hooking by using Xposed module could not only obtained the data flows within a running app, but also alter its behaviour by modifying return value. </p><div align="center"><br><div style="width:60%;margin-top:-20px;"><br><img src="/2018/08/21/analysing-high-privileges/introXposedHooking.png" title="Example of Hooking Process: An Imaginary Screenshot App"><br></div></div><p> [a]: Apktool is available on<br>    <span><a href="http://ibotpeaches.github.io/apktool/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://ibotpeaches.github.io/apktool/</a></span></p><p> [b]: dex2jar is available on<br>    <span><a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/dex2jar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://sourceforge.net/projects/dex2jar/</a></span></p><p> [c]: JD-GUI is available on <span><a href="http://jd.benow.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://jd.benow.ca/</a></span></p><p> [d]: Xposed is available on <span><a href="http://repo.xposed.info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://repo.xposed.info/</a></span></p><p> [e]: Cydia Substrate is available on<br>    <span><a href="http://www.cydiasubstrate.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.cydiasubstrate.com/</a></span></p><h1 id="Approach-amp-Case-Studies"><a href="#Approach-amp-Case-Studies" class="headerlink" title="Approach &amp; Case Studies"></a>Approach &amp; Case Studies</h1><h2 id="Approach"><a href="#Approach" class="headerlink" title="Approach"></a>Approach</h2><p>The apps using ADB workaround is usually a combination of a normal app with all functions being restricted at normal or dangerous level permission, and a proxy started by ADB and therefore has signature level permission on Android. In Android, most of apps communicates with proxies through socket channel, which has no strong protection and generic access control. A malicious app could easily obtain the control of proxy if it knows the protocol of communication between app and it. Whether the interface of the proxy is protected to prevent from third party access is the first potential issue.</p><p>Some apps implement password authentication into the protocol to strengthen protection to the proxy. However, because of the inconsistency of app and proxy’s life cycles, there must be a mechanism to temporarily save the password. By this means, a malicious app could still have chance to know the password if proper analysis has been done. Therefore, whether the protection is effective and secure enough is the second potential issue.</p><p>The approach to analyse the app and find the vulnerabilities of ADB workaround is initiated based on two potential issues we have mentioned recently, and targeted to exploit if any vulnerability has been found. We summarised this approach into four step:</p><div align="center"><br><div style="width:80%;margin-top:-20px;"><br><img src="/2018/08/21/analysing-high-privileges/approach-of-analysis.png" title="Approach of App Analysis"><br></div></div><p>(1) <strong>an analysis on the proxy activation;</strong> This analysis could be done on reading proxy activation script if exists. The script could be either in batch file or bash script depends on which OS, Windows or Linux, to be run. Some apps do not provide script file to the user for Windows OS, for instead, a desktop application with UI is provided to achieve better user experience. In this circumstance, the Linux version of activation package is recommended to be download because script file is more widely used and possibly given on Linux OS. A simple and clear script file could disclose some details of the protocol of communication between app and proxy, such as the name of service proxy, the native executive file of proxy if any, and how the service being activated. Besides the analysis onto the script file, the name, process ID and permission group of service proxy running in the background could also be found by typing command “<code>adb shell ps</code>” in ADB through USB to the device. Moreover, the port opened for the communication between service proxy and app could be found in similar way by typing ADB command “<code>adb shell netstat</code>” to retrieve all active network usage on the device. However, in this step, the pairing of process and specific port listening may not be able to be observed if multiple proxies had been activated, like the scenario during the case study of app III.</p><p>(2) <strong>an analysis on the APK file;</strong> Concept of reverse engineering will be involved in this step like APK decompilation. Once the service proxy and port number have been identified, the next step is to discover the implementation of the communication between proxy and app in APK file. The APK file could be unpackaged and decompiled into smali/Java source code or assembly code, by using tools like <em>Apktool</em> or <em>dex2jar</em>. The smali/Java code has supreme readability which may help us to look through different classes to locate the code of protocol’s implementation. In fact, the decompilation analysis may not always to be proved as a smooth and easy process because most of developers obfuscated their code before releasing the APK file to the app Store. In this situation, the disassembly will be helpful and a supplement to the samli/Java code reading. Reading assembly code could help us recognise the constant strings and numbers defined within same class. For example, the magic number used for authentication in app II , which is <code>89234820</code>, was found in this manner.</p><p>(3) <strong>an dynamic analysis;</strong> Only reading the script and source code may not be sufficient to sketch out the entire protocol between proxy and app. The objective of dynamic analysis is to find both control flow and data flow occurred when the app interacts with service proxy. Reading logs through <code>logcat</code> is a simple but effective way to gain a brief understanding to the protocol. However, hooking by <em>Xposed</em> framework will be one of the best solution to complete the analysis when the source code has been enforced with strict obfuscation or an authentication has been applied onto the socket channel between app and proxy server. Hooking method could be forced onto the key methods in class(es) in charge of communication between app and proxy which has been discovered in last step, then sniff and extract the arguments passed in and return value through the system logs. According to the case studies in this project, the methods to be hooked are mostly used to handle the action trigger (e.g. <code>takeScreenshot</code>) and socket channel I/O (e.g. <code>write</code>). Hooking on the prior method(s) by printing logs could show us the control flow of the protocol, and hooking on the latter method(s) by extracting arguments’ value could help us understand the data flow between service proxy and app itself. By now with both control flow and data flow confirmed, the protocol between service proxy and app, which used to escalate privilege on Android OS, has been unveiled.</p><p>(4) <strong>authentication analysis if any;</strong> There is very possibly an authentication process if any series of numbers or a random string was found in the data flow of the protocol. In that case, it is encouraged to clarify if the password a constant (like app II) or dynamic (like app III); then followed by determining relationship between the password and life cycle of app or/and proxy(s) if the password is found to be dynamic. For the dynamic password, if the password change is triggered by proxy and independent of app itself, the password is generally stored at somewhere that the app has permission to read; otherwise the password itself or the mechanism of its changing should be able to be found in app’s source code.<br>Once these four steps listed above have been fully understood, attackers are theoretically able to exploit an app that uses ADB workaround in a programmatic manner. In the later part of this chapter, case studies on three apps using ADB workaround will be analysed and one of them will be exploited by apply this approach.</p><h2 id="Case-Studies"><a href="#Case-Studies" class="headerlink" title="Case Studies"></a>Case Studies</h2><div align="center"><br><div style="width:60%;margin-top:-20px;"><br><img src="/2018/08/21/analysing-high-privileges/classification-apps.png" title="Classification of Mainstream Screenshot Apps on Google Play Store"><br></div></div><p>A group of screenshot apps with the highest popularity and the most recent updates were chosen from the Google Play Store. There are altogether 13 screenshot apps being downloaded from Google Play Store and installed on testing Android devices. We have run all of them by following their instruction, observed the outcomes, and recorded all key information. The statistics of those 13 screenshot apps could be found in Table below in appendix of this report. After reviewing all 13 screenshot apps, as shown in Figure above, a simple classification were been made according to their functionality. These apps were firstly be separated according to their compatibility with un-rooted devices. 5 apps has instruction saying that they only support rooted devices. Among the 8 apps which works on un-rooted devices, 6 apps could only take screenshot by pressing hard-key combination (usually power key + volume down key), which may vary with configuration of manufactures, This method almost works on Android OS version 4.0 and later versions only [10]. Two apps left, <em>Screenshot Ultimate</em> developed by “icecoldapps” (noted as app I) and <em>No Root Screenshot It</em> developed by “edwardkim” (noted as app II) , has been found using ADB workaround to take screenshot and selected in case studies.</p><p>Unlike taking screenshot, screen recording is the function that users could not obtain by either third party apps without signature level permission, or any solution provided by Android OS. Keyword “<em>screen recording</em>” has been searched on Google Play Store. The number of apps found is much less than the searching result of “screenshot”. However, most of screen recording apps are using ADB workaround to achieve its functionality. In this project, one recording app, <em>FREE screen recorder NO ROOT</em> developed by “Invisibility Ltd” (Noted as app III), has also been chosen and analysed in case studies.</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Name</strong></th><th><strong>Description</strong></th><th><strong>Size</strong></th><th><strong>Identity Package Name</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Screenshot Ultimate</td><td>Screenshot</td><td>3.2M</td><td>com.icecoldapps, screenshotultimate</td></tr><tr><td>No Root Screenshot It</td><td>Screenshot</td><td>838k</td><td>com.edwardkim.android, screenshotitfullnoroot</td></tr><tr><td>FREE screen recorder NO ROOT</td><td>Recording</td><td>7.4M</td><td>uk.org.invisibility, recordablefree</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 id="App-I-–-“Screenshot-Ultimate”"><a href="#App-I-–-“Screenshot-Ultimate”" class="headerlink" title="App I – “Screenshot Ultimate”"></a>App I – “Screenshot Ultimate”</h3><p>“Screenshot Ultimate” is one typical screenshot app that does not require a rooted device. It supports screenshot taking through ADB workaround. However, it is not like the deal above board since too obvious instruction may bring Google’s restriction. The ADB workaround is mentioned in a paragraph of “Help” instruction, and the URL to download the script and other necessary files are given in another place and could only be found in “Setting” &gt;“Capture Methods” &gt;“Manual”. Overall, it is still kind of good experience because of detailed step-by-step instruction and troubleshooting notes.</p><div align="center"><br><div style="width:70%;margin-top:-20px;"><br><img src="/2018/08/21/analysing-high-privileges/tutorial-icecoldapps.png" title="Steps to Find Unrooted Screenshot Method in App I"><br></div></div><h4 id="Analysis-of-ADB-Channel"><a href="#Analysis-of-ADB-Channel" class="headerlink" title="Analysis of ADB Channel"></a>Analysis of ADB Channel</h4><p>The native executable file, named “<code>screenshotultimatenative1</code>”, and scripts for both Linux and Windows OS have been downloaded as a zipped file from the URL given in the help instruction. After reading through the script file, the flow of service activation has been summarized and shown in Figure Service Activation of App I. With the process name of service running in the background, what we are going to do is to analyse the APK file and unveil the protocol of screenshot taking process between app and that service.</p><div align="center"><br><div style="width:25%;margin-top:-20px;"><br><img src="/2018/08/21/analysing-high-privileges/activation-screenshot-ultimate.png" title="Proxy Activation of App I"><br></div></div><h4 id="Decompilation-of-APK"><a href="#Decompilation-of-APK" class="headerlink" title="Decompilation of APK"></a>Decompilation of APK</h4><p>The APK file is generated from Java code through a systematic routine which might be easy to be analysed when compared with the native executable.

Once the APK file has been obtained, the decompilation could be done for analysis purpose.</p><p>The reverse engineering tool “dex2jar” has been used to decompile the APK file to the jar format. Then further Java decompilation has been done by “JD-GUI”. So far, the original source code should be perfectly reversed if there is no exception happened due to code obfuscation or other protection mechanism. Unfortunately, the class organisation of the code obtained from the decompilation of “Screenshot Ultimate” is not quite readable because the obfuscation is believed to be applied. Some core methods which control the logic flow of screenshot taking are missing.

After carefully reading through the source code of “Screenshot Ultimate”, we found some hints to shape the mechanism of screenshot taking. For example, there was an address in Android OS partition “<code>/system/bin/fbread</code>” appearing more than once in the obfuscated classes, just like the code snippet (<code>com.icecoldapps.screenshotultimate.an</code>) shown below: </p><figure class="highlight java"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br><span class="line">17</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">for</span> (;;)</span><br><span class="line">&#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">if</span> (!<span class="keyword">this</span>.k)</span><br><span class="line">    &#123;</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="keyword">if</span> (!<span class="keyword">this</span>.l) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">            <span class="keyword">break</span> label470;</span><br><span class="line">        &#125;</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="keyword">throw</span> <span class="keyword">new</span> Exception(<span class="keyword">this</span>.m);</span><br><span class="line">        t = <span class="string">"/system/bin/fbread"</span>;</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="keyword">break</span>;</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">try</span></span><br><span class="line">    &#123;</span><br><span class="line">        Thread.sleep(<span class="number">200L</span>);</span><br><span class="line">    &#125;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">catch</span> (Exception paramContext) &#123;&#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>The occurrence of “<code>/system/bin/fbread</code>” suggests that this app was very likely taking screenshot by reading image data from <em>framebuffer</em>, which is commonly expressed as short writing “fb” in Android development. </p><p>Many apps take screenshots by using a library called <em>Android screenshot library</em> (known as “ASL”) [c] A comparison has been done between the native executive provided by both ASL and “Screenshot Ultimate” to validate that presumption. The exact equivalence in file checksum value among two native executives as shown in Figure below indicates that the “Screenshot Ultimate” is one of the third party apps that take screenshot by invoking ASL APIs on unrooted devices.</p><div align="center"><br><div style="width:90%;margin-top:-20px;"><br><img src="/2018/08/21/analysing-high-privileges/checksum-comp-icecoldapps.png" title="Checksum of Native Executive Files from App I & ASL"><br></div></div><p>The ASL enables Android developer to write screenshot app without root requirement. Once the user followeds the instruction and executed the native executive file by running the given scripts, proxy with shell permission could help user take screenshot which the application has no privilege to do so. Take “Screenshot Ultimate” as example, user could just click the “Screenshot” button when user want to take screenshot of his/her device, then the app send the screenshot command to the proxy running in background via socket channel, following by the proxy as a process named “<code>screenshotultimatenative1</code>” reading the current hardware framebuffer, converting to the image format and saving to the specific location.</p><p>Hence the protocol of communication between app and proxy won’t be difficult to be sketched out. After writing a demo app using ASL API and running on the test devices, the result of screenshot taking was proved to be same as “Screenshot Ultimate”. The communication protocol to take a screenshot by invoking ASL library was shown in Figure below. </p><div align="center"><br><div style="width:60%;margin-top:-20px;"><br><img src="/2018/08/21/analysing-high-privileges/process-diagram-screenshot-ultimate.png" title="Process of Application Taking Screenshot of App I"><br></div></div><h3 id="App-II-–-“No-Root-Screenshot-It”"><a href="#App-II-–-“No-Root-Screenshot-It”" class="headerlink" title="App II – “No Root Screenshot It”"></a>App II – “No Root Screenshot It”</h3><p>Similar with the “<em>Screenshot Ultimate</em>”, “<em>No Root Screenshot It</em>” is another screenshot app does not require rooting the devices. However, what makes “<em>No Root Screenshot It</em>” unique is the strong security and protection enforcement have been done during the development. Obfuscation has been conducted onto both service activator and APK. Meanwhile, the communication channel between app and proxy has also been protected by using some identification trick like a password, which will be pointed out later.</p><h4 id="Analysis-of-ADB-Channel-1"><a href="#Analysis-of-ADB-Channel-1" class="headerlink" title="Analysis of ADB Channel"></a>Analysis of ADB Channel</h4><p>The service activation has been done by executing a .Net application named “Screenshot It Enabler” rather than simply running a batch script. Therefore the analysis of the service activation will be more complicated because it is involved with the decompilation of .Net application. Moreover, the script file was not found in the enabler’s package, which means it has been packaged into the APK and the purpose of the enabler is just to run the “shell” command to execute it.</p><div align="center"><br><div style="width:28%;margin-top:-20px;"><br><img src="/2018/08/21/analysing-high-privileges/activation-no-root-screenshotit.png" title="Proxy Activation of App II"><br></div></div><p>In this project, a .Net decompilation tool named “JetBrains dotPeek” [d] has been used to do the reverse engineering of the activation tool. Even though the enabler application has been obfuscated, some variables and C# code logics could still be recovered after the decompilation. The scripts to enable the proxy has been unveiled by observing the C# code from the decompilation result. In addition, the file name of the script could be confirmed as “screenshot” in this way. Then the script file’s location could be easily found by browsing the file manager on a rooted phone, or by decompiling the APK file to search the file name. The code snippet providing key clue is indicated below.</p><pre><code>startInfo2.FileName = &quot;adb.exe&quot;;startInfo2.Arguments = &quot;shell /data/data/&quot; + this.b + &quot;/screenshot daemon&quot;;</code></pre><h4 id="Static-Analysis-of-Socket-Channel"><a href="#Static-Analysis-of-Socket-Channel" class="headerlink" title="Static Analysis of Socket Channel"></a>Static Analysis of Socket Channel</h4><p>After clarifying the ADB communication to activate the proxy, the following steps will focus on discovering the communication between app and the proxy, thereby obtain the command(s) to control proxy to take screenshot at any occasion. On the APK side, obfuscation has been down very strongly onto both class names and variable names, which makes it impossible to observe the entire protocol by just reading the decompiled Java code. It is cleared that the class named <code>ScreenshotService</code> is in charge of the communication with the proxy but the code is not as readable as the previous one <em>Screenshot Ultimate</em>. What makes things worse is that one magic number, <code>89234820</code>, being found and being referenced multiple times by reading through the assembly code of <code>ScreenshotService</code> class. For this reason, it is proved that there is a great possibility that the app having (1) multiple communication session with proxy to take a screenshot; and/or (2) an authentication trick to indicate the app’s identity, which might be the reason of the existence of the magic number <code>89234820</code>.</p><pre><code>0xfe04: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................|0xfe14: 38 39 32 33 34 38 32 30  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |89234820........|0xfe24: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................|</code></pre><h4 id="Dynamic-Analysis-of-Socket-Channel"><a href="#Dynamic-Analysis-of-Socket-Channel" class="headerlink" title="Dynamic Analysis of Socket Channel"></a>Dynamic Analysis of Socket Channel</h4><p>Unlike what we have done in case study of app I, only static analysis is not adequate to find the protocol that used for communication between “<em>No Root Screenshot It</em>” and proxy. In order to unveil what kind of command that the app has sent to the proxy to take screenshot and how they interact with each other, a dynamic analysis technique called “hooking” was brought in this project.</p><p>Hooking system APIs on Android could be enabled by using a framework known as <em>Xposed</em> on a rooted device. By reading the decompiled code during the static analysis, the communication between proxy and app has been found conducted through socket channel of Android. Therefore, the monitoring of the socket channel during the communication between app and proxy could be done by writing a module based on Xposed framework which hook all the socket channel related packet data IO functions.</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Class Name</strong></th><th><strong>Method Name</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>screenShotServiceClass</code></td><td><code>takeScreenshot</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>screenShotServiceClass</code></td><td><code>read</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>screenShotServiceClass</code></td><td><code>write</code></td></tr></tbody></table><p> Methods Hooked in App II Dynamic Analysis</p><p>The <code>takeScreenshot</code> was hooked to indicate the beginning of communication.</p><div align="center"><br><div style="width:65%;margin-top:-20px;"><br><img src="/2018/08/21/analysing-high-privileges/process-diagram-noroot-screenshot-it.png" title="Process of Application Taking Screenshot of App II"><br></div></div><p>After deploying the Xposed module named “hookNoRootScreenshotIt”, all the necessary data have been logged and printed out during the IO operation of the socket channel. The control flow of the app and proxy communication has been finally unveiled and shown in Figure above.</p><h3 id="App-III-–-“FREE-screen-recorder-NO-ROOT”"><a href="#App-III-–-“FREE-screen-recorder-NO-ROOT”" class="headerlink" title="App III – “FREE screen recorder NO ROOT”"></a>App III – “FREE screen recorder NO ROOT”</h3><p>In addition to screenshot apps, a screen recording app named “<em>FREE screen recorder NO ROOT</em>” has also been analysed in this project. According to the description on the Google Play Store, this app could enable users to record their screen regardless of which app or activity is on the top of stack, and then export the video recorded as MP4 format. The entire process doesn’t request users to root their devices.</p><h4 id="Proxy-Service-Identification"><a href="#Proxy-Service-Identification" class="headerlink" title="Proxy Service Identification"></a>Proxy Service Identification</h4><p>Similar with those two screenshot apps we have analysed previously, this app III also requires users to complete the proxy activation before the app unlocking the record function. However, this activation process on Windows OS is executed by running an <em>exe</em> file, and the same process on Linux OS is also started by a well compiled and packaged <em>jar</em> file, which makes the analysis on the proxy activation very difficult. </p><pre><code>&gt; adb shell psUSER     PID   PPID  VSIZE  RSS     WCHAN    PC         NAME......shell     26757 1     1084   240   c06f020c b6ef8500 S        /data/data/uk.org.invisibility.recordablefree/files/inputservshell     26760 1     1076   188   c06f020c b6f01500 S        /data/data/uk.org.invisibility.recordablefree/files/videoserv</code></pre><p> Missing of activation script doesn’t mean the identification of proxy is impossible. Actually, with the help of ADB, we could still find the details proxy(s) activated, including the process name, PID and the port(s) listening. Here, two ADB commends, “<code>ps</code>” and “<code>netstat</code>”, have been used to retrieve the list of running processes and active ports on the Android device. By this means the proxy and the ports number could be found. There are two services namely “<code>videoserv</code>” and “<code>inputserv</code>” running on the background to enable users to record their screen. One of them uses port 7938, and the other one uses port 7940 to communicate with app.</p><pre><code>&gt; adb shell netstatProto   Recv-Q  Send-Q  Local Address       Foreign     Address State......tcp 0   0   0.0.0.0:7938        0.0.0.0:*   LISTENtcp 0   0   0.0.0.0:7940        0.0.0.0:*   LISTEN</code></pre><h4 id="Decompilation"><a href="#Decompilation" class="headerlink" title="Decompilation"></a>Decompilation</h4><p>By now we have still yet to connect all the clues found in that last step because the port(s) listening did not tell us which services they are belonging to. For that reason, the decompilation is needed for the further analysis.</p><p>Firstly, the APK file has been extracted out of the device, and then been decompiled into samli code. The clues that recently found, two port numbers 7938 and 7940, could be searched within the source code to locate the key classes we will analyse on. As the searching result of keyword 7938 shown below, we found the variable name which bearing that port number, namely “<code>videoport</code>”. Similarly, the port 7940 has been found in variable name “<code>inputport</code>” recorded in same <em>xml</em> file.</p><pre><code>user{at}ubuntu:$ grep -rnw &apos;/home/user/Documents/Recordable Free/&apos; -e &quot;7938&quot;/home/user/Documents/Recordable Free/res/values/integers.xml:6:        &lt;integer name=&quot;video\textunderscore port&quot;&gt;7938&lt;/integer&gt;</code></pre><p>Next, we continued searching the occurrence of two variables “<code>videoport</code>” and “<code>audioport</code>”. After filtering from the search result, we preliminarily confirmed that the code reflecting the control flow and data flow was located in class “<code>RecordService</code>” and “<code>Projection</code>” separately.</p><p>Take the communication between video server and app as example, the core function in charge of the communication flow is supposed to be “<code>videoWrite</code>”, which located in line 1038 in the smali code of <code>RecordService</code>. This <code>videoWrite</code> method has been called many time once after the occurrence of the constant string with all letter being capitalised, which is suspected to be the command sending to the server. Moreover, by browsering through the smali code, a method named “<code>openSocket</code>” has been called within the class <code>RecordService</code>, which helps us to come up with a presumption that the protocol we are going to discover was achieved through socket channel.</p><pre><code>.line 1038const-string v1, &quot;AUTH &quot;invoke-virtual {p0, v1},Luk/org/invisibility/recorder/service/RecordService;             -&gt;videoWrite(Ljava/lang/String;)V.line 1036const-string v1, &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;invoke-virtual {p0}, Luk/org/invisibility/recorder/service/RecordService;             -&gt;getResources()Landroid/content/res/Resources;move-result-object v5sget v6, Luk/org/invisibility/recorder/core/R$integer;-&gt;video_port:Iinvoke-virtual {v5, v6}, Landroid/content/res/Resources;-&gt;getInteger(I)Imove-result v5invoke-static {v1, v5}, Luk/org/invisibility/recorder/service/RecordService;             -&gt;openSocket(Ljava/lang/String;I)Imove-result v1iput v1, p0, Luk/org/invisibility/recorder/service/RecordService;             -&gt;mVideoReadFd:I</code></pre><h4 id="Dynamic-Analysis-on-Socket-Channel"><a href="#Dynamic-Analysis-on-Socket-Channel" class="headerlink" title="Dynamic Analysis on Socket Channel"></a>Dynamic Analysis on Socket Channel</h4><p>Like what we have done onto the app II, hooking by exposed is always considered the most convenient and effective way to sketch out the complete control flow and data flow of the protocol. The target function to be hooked has been confirmed during the previous analysis, which is “<code>videoWrite</code>” located in class named “<code>RecordService</code>”. In order to find as many details about the protocol as possible, some other methods located in the same class of “<code>videoWrite</code>” have also been hooked and shown in Table below. With the information obtained from the output logs of methods’ hooking, the protocol of the communication between video server and app to start screen recording has been found and displayed below</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Class Name</strong></th><th><strong>Method Name</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>RecordService</code></td><td><code>videoWrite</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>RecordService</code></td><td><code>writeCaptureOption</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>RecordService</code></td><td><code>startListen</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>RecordService</code></td><td><code>stopListen</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>RecordService</code></td><td><code>startCountdown</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>RecordService</code></td><td><code>startRecord</code></td></tr><tr><td><code>RecordService</code></td><td><code>stopRecord</code></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Methods Hooked in App III Dynamic Analysis</p><div align="center"><br><div style="width:90%;margin-top:-20px;"><br><img src="/2018/08/21/analysing-high-privileges/analysis-recordable-free.png" title="Process of Screen Recording on App III"><br></div></div><h4 id="Poaching-the-Passcode"><a href="#Poaching-the-Passcode" class="headerlink" title="Poaching the Passcode"></a>Poaching the Passcode</h4><p>A sixteen-digit-long string <code>01c5cdf96b5a2a63</code> as showed in Figure above grabbed our attentions because it was presumed to be the authentication code, or password for short, according to the location of its occurrence. Nevertheless, it has not yet been confirmed to be a string constant or a dynamic changing string so far. In order to clarify the nature of that password, a series of experiments has been conducted.</p><p>Firstly, we close the app after taking a screen recording video clips, then re-opened it and took another screen recording. Hooking logs shown in logcat console showed that the password did’t change. In that means, the password is independent of app’s life-cycle. We have repeated the above steps for many times and all the results proved the conclusion is correct. Next, we killed all proxies related to this app and did the service activation again. The purpose of this experiment is to determine if the password is independent of the life cycle of proxies. If answer is yes, that means this password is generated by one of the proxies, and will keep updating each time re-activating the proxies, such as rebooting the device. On the contrary, the password would be confirmed to be a constant, which is same as the magic number in the case study of app II, if there is no evidence indicating that the password itself varies with different instance of proxy. After many times repeating the above steps, the password was found changed each time we re-activate the proxies.</p><p>Since the password is proved to be generated by proxy, there must be a place that the proxy stored the code at somewhere that the app with user privilege could access and read. This idea was generated by recalling the analysis on a backup app called “<em>Helium</em>” in paper of Bai et al. [1]. After a series of searching initiated by this idea, we finally located the password in a <em>log</em> file named <code>videoserv.log</code> under the directory <code>data/local/tmp</code>, and luckily found the first occurrence of the current password was always after the word “<code>AUTH</code>” in the log file. For that reason, the attackers could all along hold the current password by writing a simple code snippet on Android to read the log file and then extract the string at given location.<br>    …<br>    12618: ready (1408)<br>    12618: client_read_fd: 4<br>    12618: client_write_fd: 4<br>    12618: AUTH 01c5cdf96b5a2a63 (1422)<br>    12618: cmd_auth (1072)<br>    12618: key accepted (1076)<br>    12618: SET VideoScale SCALE_FULL (1422)<br>    …</p><p> [a]: <span><a href="http://www.apkmirror.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.apkmirror.com/</a></span></p><p> [b]: Apk Extractor could be downloaded at<br>    <span><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ext.ui&amp;hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ext.ui&amp;hl=en</a></span></p><p> [c]: Android screenshot library is available at<br>    <span><a href="https://code.google.com/archive/p/android-screenshot-library/downloads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://code.google.com/archive/p/android-screenshot-library/downloads</a></span></p><p> [d]: dotPeek is available on<br>    <span><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/decompiler/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.jetbrains.com/decompiler/</a></span></p><h1 id="Exploitation"><a href="#Exploitation" class="headerlink" title="Exploitation"></a>Exploitation</h1><p>The processes of privilege escalation in three apps have been completely unveiled during the analysis and described in last chapter. Theoretically speaking, if there is a malicious app being installed on your device while the proxy running in background of OS, behaving exactly same as the original screenshot app, it can unperceivably steal the screenshot of your device at any time on any occasion. In this project, the app II is chosen to be conducted an exploitation to prove the privacy vulnerabilities of ADB workaround.</p><p>Unlike the back-up app named <em>Helium</em> mentioned in the paper of Bai, et al. [1], app II doesn’t implement a dynamic identity schemes. That means the exploitation of app II in this project, could be conducted in a very straight forward manner. Besides that, the malicious app could also co-exist with the genuine App. In this chapter, the exploitation processes of app II will be introduced and the outcome of exploitation will be shown at the end of this chapter.</p><div align="center"><br><div style="width:65%;margin-top:-20px;"><br><img src="/2018/08/21/analysing-high-privileges/exploit-sequence-diagram-edward.png" title="Sequence Diagram of Exploitation of App II"><br></div></div><p>An app named “<em>exploitNoRootScreenshotIt</em>” simulating the malicious exploitation of the app II had been implemented for the demonstration purpose. In that exploitation app, there are in total four messages being organized into two lots and sent out to the <code>localhost</code> on port <code>6003</code> through Android’s socket channel. The first two messages are used for the configuration purpose, and the last two messages are sent out as screenshot taking command once the acknowledgement of first batch messages have been received from the proxy, which is “<code>screenshotService</code>” running in the background. The entire process was displayed in figure above.</p><p> The screenshot obtained is converted to a <em>bmp</em> file under the sub-directory named “<code>temp</code>” [a]. The access permission of that folder was set as read-only to the user group. Therefore, once the screenshot has been taken by the proxy, the exploitation app could access to the newly captured screenshot located in the “<code>temp</code>” folder and make a copy to the target location such as folder under external storage “<code>/sdcard/hack_screenshots/</code>”.</p><div align="center"><br><div style="width:90%;margin-top:-20px;"><br><img src="/2018/08/21/analysing-high-privileges/tutorial-exploit.png" title="Steps to Take a Screenshot in Exploitation App"><br></div></div><p>The screenshot image is renamed according to the capture time to avoid being overwritten and convenient maintenance at the same time. The exploitation has been tested on two devices (one <em>Nexus 7</em> and one <em>Xiaomi Rednote 3G</em> ) and worked well just like the genuine app “<em>No Root Screenshot It</em>”. This exploitation could even been further designed and programmed to take screenshot automatically with specific frequency without any notice of user, the user’s privacy could be consequently exposed to attacker. </p><p> [a]: The full directory path is <code>/data/data/com.edwardkim.android.screenshotitfullnoroot/temp</code></p><h1 id="Related-Work"><a href="#Related-Work" class="headerlink" title="Related Work"></a>Related Work</h1><p>There are some previous studies unveiling the security risk of ADB workaround despite it is considered much safer than device rooting. Security concern of ADB workaround mainly comes from the difference between roles of proxy and application on Android OS. In this project, these risks could be summarised into two types –</p><p>(1) whether other apps could send commend to the opening proxy; and –</p><p>(2) whether the communication between app and proxy is properly protected if the scenario of (1) is possible to happen.</p><p>The description of the first kind of security concern could be found in the paper written in 2014 by Lin, et al. The communication channel between the application and its ADB proxy relies on network sockets without any protection enforced. For that reason, once an ADB proxy has been activated, any application has the privilege to communicate with it and even request service from it at any time without restrictions. This vulnerability gives attackers a chance to analyse the protocol of such communication and build a malicious application to request service from ADB proxy exactly as same as what genuine application does [14]. </p><p>Some developers have realised the fact that the communication channel between the application and ADB proxy may be risky, and therefore implemented some authentication routines to strengthen security. However in the paper of Bai, et al, it was proved that such authentication was ineffective as long as the reverse engineering and analysis being feasible on given application. What developer can do to secure the communication is only applying some basic authentication since there is no way to enforce strong protection onto the socket network. That authentication is usually very weak in front of analysis [1]. Some application like “<em>Helium</em>”, a backup/restore application mentioned in the paper written by Bai, et al., has been found using protection during the communication between application and ADB proxy. ADB proxy requests a password that sent out from a specific process to provide service. Unfortunately, vulnerability was found in the protocol of password distribution. The password generated each time when ADB proxy being activated, and it is independent of app’s life cycle. In this way, the proxy has to find a place that readable by apps executed with user group privilege, save the password into a file and waiting for app to read from it. This life cycle inconsistency makes adversary possible to find the current using password and thereby exploit the genuine app by writing another app following exactly same protocol in communication with the ADB proxy.</p><h1 id="Conclusion-amp-Future-Work"><a href="#Conclusion-amp-Future-Work" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion &amp; Future Work"></a>Conclusion &amp; Future Work</h1><p>In this project, we have come up with an approach to find security vulnerabilities of ADB workaround. By conducting case studies on three different apps, we found most of apps using ADB workaround have risk of being exploited. Followed by case studies, an exploitation has been done successfully, which proves and verifies the approach we have summarised in the analysis.</p><p>This project could be treated as not only a support to those previous studies on the similar field, but also a reference to the Android developers. The successful exploitation in this project is sufficient to show that the security and protection enforcement of the Android apps during design and development periods is crucial to users’ privacy and doomed to be an endless and challenging journey.</p><p>Some suggestions on Android development have been summarised throughout the study and research in this project. The Android developers are advised to raise security awareness and take some security practices into account when implementing the functionality based on ADB workaround, including:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Access control for socket channel communication</strong>. An access control protocol is strongly advised to be implemented on both app and proxy sides. It could be like exchanging of passcode, to enable the proxy to validate the identity of app. A good access authentication should not been exploited by analysing on solely one side among app and proxy. In this way, the proxy could reject to provide service when the command received through socket channel failed to validate the identity of app. The objective of this advice is to solve the problem (1) mentioned in Chapter 5.</p></li><li><p><strong>Identification for application</strong>. Only the access control is not enough to ensure the security when facing to the second problem described in Chapter 5. One possible solution for this issue may be writing a <em>handshake</em> process in the proxy implementation, to make both app and proxy exchange their authentication. And the ADB proxy will execute the commend only after a successful validation. Thus the proxy service will only accept the command sent from the exactly same app. Once the app is removed and re-installed, regardless of genuine app or malicious app, another handshake validation will be required thereby to ensure the ADB proxy will not be misused.</p></li></ol><h1 id="Acknowledge"><a href="#Acknowledge" class="headerlink" title="Acknowledge"></a>Acknowledge</h1><p>As a project in infocomm security area, this project has been a challenging but wonderful experience throughout my entire mater programme.

&lt;p&gt;The number of Android smartphone and tablet users has experienced a rapid growth in the past few years and it raises users’ awareness on the privacy and security of their mobile devices. The features of openness and extensibility make Android unique, attractive and competitive but meanwhile vulnerable to malicious attack. There are lots of users rooting their Android devices for some useful functions, which are not originally provided to developers and users, such as backup and taking screenshot. However, after observing the danger of rooting devices, the developers begin to look for other non-root alternatives to implement those functions.&lt;/p&gt;

Although Android has actively strengthened its security mechanisms and fixed a great number of vulnerabilities as its version evolves, new vulnerabilities still keep emerging. Vulnerability exploitation is a common way to achieve privilege escalation on Android systems. In order to provide a holistic and comprehensive understanding of the exploits, we conduct a survey of publicly available 63 exploits for Android devices. Based on the analysis of the collected real-world exploits, we construct a taxonomy on Android exploitation and present the similarities/differences and strength/weakness of different types of exploits. <a id="more"></a> On the other hand, we conduct an evaluation on a group of selected exploits on our test devices. Based on both the theoretical analysis and the experimental results of the evaluation, we present our insight into the Android exploitation. The growth of exploit categories along the timeline reflects three trends:</p><ol><li>the individual exploits are more device specific and operating system version specific; </li><li>exploits targeting vendors’ customization grow steadily where the increase of other types of exploits slows down; and</li><li>memory corruption gradually becomes the primary approach to initiate exploitation.</li></ol><p>The outcome of this study is published as an article titled as <strong>A survey of Android exploits in the wild</strong> on Elsevier Computers &amp; Security.

Along with the development of mobile technology and the prevalence of Internet services, smart mobile devices become the principal digital assistant that people use for information acquiring, instant messaging, online socialization, Internet financing and other Internet services. The market share of devices with Android operating system keeps growing since its release in 2008 and has been dominating the mobile system market for a long time. According to the latest market statistics done by IDC, Android managed to capture 85.0% of the worldwide smartphone market share by the 1st quarter of 2017. In the meantime, the global shipment of new Android devices is experiencing an average of 10% growth each year since 2015. Due to people’s heavy reliance on mobile devices and the popularity of Android mobile systems, the privacy concern and security issues on Android systems catch great attention from mobile users, industry players and academic researchers. At the same time, it also makes Android the prominent target of attackers. Unfortunately, Android vulnerabilities keep emerging and have successfully been turned into their exploitation even though Android has strengthened its security mechanisms and fixed a great number of vulnerabilities as its version evolves. </p><p>Vulnerability exploitation is a common way to achieve higher privilege on Android systems. Exploiting Android devices has been a popular topic since Android was firstly introduced in 2008. There are numerous exploits being implemented in the Android history. From the users’ perspective, an exploit program can help them to bypass the security mechanism of their Android devices to achieve better control of their devices by obtaining a higher privilege, e.g., rooting their devices. On the other hand, the exploitation could also be misused to gain the control of victims’ devices where the attacker can obtain financial profit from selling users’ privacy (e.g., account information). We intend to provide a holistic and comprehensive understanding of the exploits that can be used to attain higher privileges in Android system. It would be helpful in terms of understanding how individual exploits work and how the trend of the exploits on Android would be.<br>In this study, we are going to present a survey on all the publicly available Android exploits gathered on the Internet. We provide a taxonomy of the Android exploits and analyze the similarities/differences and strengths/weaknesses. We demonstrate the trend of Android exploits by analyzing the development of each exploit category. Furthermore, we evaluate a group of exploits on our test devices. In summary, our contribution could be summarized into three points: </p><ol><li><p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first complete and exhaustive survey on publicly available Android exploits. By analyzing each exploit, we filter out those exploits with the same way of working but different nicknames and finally distill 63 different exploits. By referring to our survey, an reader can easily find out the affected device models and Android versions of a publicly released exploit as well as the vulnerabilities behind it.</p></li><li><p>This paper conducts a comparative and in-depth analysis of existing real-world Android exploits for the first time. We propose a taxonomy and accordingly initiate a classification of these exploits. We also carry out a comparison among different types of the exploits. By analyzing similarities/differences and strengths/weaknesses of each type of exploits, we point out the evolution of exploitation throughout the history of Android and forecast the future trends of the exploitation on Android devices.</p></li><li><p>With a large volume of information of these exploits being collected, we select a group of exploits by matching their targeting devices and Android versions to our test devices. Then we conduct an experiment to validate those selected exploits. By observing the experimental results, we present our evaluation result and discuss our findings correspondingly. </p></li></ol><p>In the following section, we will first propose a taxonomy on Android exploitation considering various perspectives. Next, we present the list of exploits gathered from multiple online sources, followed by analysis based on our classification results. Due to the limitation of space, the evaluation of those exploits on actual devices are not illustarated in this post.

With this taxonomy depicted in the figure below, we describe an exploit from 3 different perspectives - societal perspective, practical perspective, and technical perspective. From the societal aspect, we discuss who the potential attacker is, what is his or her motive in conducting the exploitation, and the possible consequence (risk) if such exploitation has been exercised. From the practical perspective, we discuss the pre-requisite for the exploitation, the steps to conduct exploitation, and the expected outcome (output) with the execution of the exploit. Finally, from the technical perspective, we discuss all the key elements of an exploit in an attack analysis model, including attack surfaces, attack vectors, and vulnerable targets.</p><div align="center" style="padding-bottom:15px; width:100;"><img src="/2018/07/01/exploit-survey/taxonomy.jpg">The Taxonomy of Android Exploits</div><h2 id="Societal-Perspectives"><a href="#Societal-Perspectives" class="headerlink" title="Societal Perspectives"></a>Societal Perspectives</h2><h3 id="S1-Attacker-and-S2-Motive"><a href="#S1-Attacker-and-S2-Motive" class="headerlink" title="(S1) Attacker and (S2) Motive"></a>(S1) Attacker and (S2) Motive</h3><p>We use the term attacker to present the role of the entity who initiates the exploitation regardless he or she is the owner of the device or has malicious intention. In consideration of moral and legal qualms, most of the exploits are introduced to the public as a tool to enable devices’ owners to gain superior privilege in their daily usage. However, it does not guarantee the exploit will never be used by people with malicious intent. Hacktivists and cyber-spies could profit from making use of exploit programs to gain control of the victims’ device stealthily without users’ consent or awareness. Thieves could continue using the stolen devices by obtaining superior privilege even if those devices have been locked by their owner. Terrorists can use exploits to control and interrupt the normal operation of people’s smartphones. Moreover, exploit may also be used by the law enforcement agencies or investigators to obtain evidence for forensic purpose.</p><h3 id="S3-Possible-consequence"><a href="#S3-Possible-consequence" class="headerlink" title="(S3) Possible consequence"></a>(S3) Possible consequence</h3><p>Many exploits gain privilege with some side effects such as process crash or memory tampering, which may turn target device into an unstable status or even worse like being bricked and resulting loss of warranty. However, the risk of exploitation with malicious intention is much greater than the personal usage by the device owner. Attackers may inject virus or ransomware into the exploit program and install them in the target device once the exploit program acquired the superior privilege. The virus and ransomware could then reproduce themselves to harm other target devices. By stealing the sensitive information stored on the target device, the victim may possibly suffer from financial loss and leakage of commercial secret. The society may get into chaos and panics if the exploit has been utilized by terrorist to spread horrors and sabotage the communication functions on users’ mobile devices. On the other hands, using exploits legitimately can bring greater possibility to the law enforcement agencies or investigators to find the key evidence from the devices of people involved.</p><h2 id="Practical-Perspectives"><a href="#Practical-Perspectives" class="headerlink" title="Practical Perspectives"></a>Practical Perspectives</h2><h3 id="P1-Execution-channel-and-P2-Condition"><a href="#P1-Execution-channel-and-P2-Condition" class="headerlink" title="(P1) Execution channel and (P2) Condition"></a>(P1) Execution channel and (P2) Condition</h3><p>Execution channel describes the approach that an attacker takes to the exploit program to conduct exploitation. Condition defines the pre-requisite that must be satisfied before the attack is exercised. An exploit may request more than one conditions to ensure a successful execution. The condition set of an exploit usually varies with the execution channel. With the knowledge of execution channel and all the necessary conditions of an exploit, we can construct a scenario to present the exploitation process on a real device. Here we define 4 different execution channels and we will discuss the conditions for each execution channel in following paragraphs.<br>App execution describes the scenario that an attacker embeds the exploit code together with super-user binary files into an APK file and installs it on the target device to exercise the exploitation. The app containing exploit payload could be installed through on-device download or USB connection. Once the APK file has been installed on the target device, the privilege escalation can be triggered by any user’s interaction within the app’s interface, or even automatically while the app is running in the background. If the malicious code has been successfully executed, the privilege of the running process will be temporarily escalated, and then a persistent root could be obtained if the process with superior privilege copied the super-user binaries to the system executable directory within the Android system (Sun et al., 2015).<br>As the crafted APK containing exploit payload has almost zero chance to be published in Google Play market due to the pre-publish security check, the attacker must make sure the target device has enabled the unknown source installation option to allow the APK installation, and followed by the execution on the target device. Moreover, if the attacker wants to manually transfer the APK file to the target device through USB connection, the attacker also need to ensure that the target device has enabled USB debugging and trusted the USB connection with the computer where the attack originates.<br>Running executable scripts or binaries on the target device could be regarded as the most direct and effective way to conduct exploitation. To exploit, the attacker needs to connect the target device with the PC through USB connection, upload the script or executable binary along with all relevant files to a temporary directory on the target device by calling Android Debug Bridge (ADB for short) push command, and then execute the scripts or binaries in an ADB shell. Compared with the app execution, shell execution comes with a lower implementation cost and higher flexibility to apply to different operating system versions or device models. In addition, a successful shell execution usually results in a shell window with superior privilege, which brings convenience and freedom to the attacker to manipulate the target device.<br>Despite the strength that shell execution exploits have, there are still some restrictions that we should not ignore while conducting binary exploitation. Before the exploitation take place, what the attacker needs includes (1) a PC with drivers for both the target device and ADB installed; (2) the physical ownership of the target device to connect the device to the PC through USB at the moment of exploitation; (3) the password to unlock the screen of the target device, if any, to grant authorization and enable USB debugging and trusted connection.<br>Remote execution is another optional execution channel to conduct exploitation on Android devices. It does not require the physical connection or APK installation. Instead, remote execution usually targets some native components of Android system, such as Webkit or media playback library, to attain the privilege escalation in distance (Seacord, 2015; Ben, 2010). In practice, the attack source may be a piece of malicious code pre-loaded into a web page or a crafted media file. The exploitation will be triggered at the moment when the target device user starts viewing or previewing the crafted web page or media file. During the execution, the attack source code could achieve privilege escalation and then initiate a remote connection between the target device and attacker’s machine, and in the end, pass the full control of the target device to the attacker.<br>Remote execution stands out from the other exploitation channels that require a physical connection, and it is one of the trends of future exploitation on Android devices owing to many advantages it has (Wei et al., 2017). Firstly, the remote execution has excellent camouflage and anonymity because it is possible to attain high privilege on Android devices without a physical connection and victim’s awareness. Moreover, as the attack originates from the network rather than local files or applications, it will be difficult for security mechanism in Android system or third-party anti-virus applications to detect the exploitation by local scanning or static analysis. Nevertheless, remote exploits still have some restriction when applying the exploitation in the wild rather than the laboratory. Even though such exploitation is physical connection free, the attacker still needs to ensure that his or her attacking device is connected to the same network with the target device and the IP address of the attacking device must be filled in the malicious payload code prior to the exploitation.<br>Besides those 3 types of common execution channels, there is an exception in the history of Android exploitation called <em>Volez</em>. <em>Volez</em> is the first ever publicly released exploit that takes advantage of one or more vulnerabilities of the target device to obtain root privilege. The <em>Volez</em> program can modify the factory OTA recovery image and insert <code>su</code> binary into the image. After that, the attacker copies the crafted image to the device storage and triggers the device recovery. The device operating system will be reset to factory status but has <code>su</code> binary located in system executable directory, which means the user of the device could easily gain root privilege by installing a superuser management app or calling su command in the ADB shell. As the <em>Volez</em> does not follow any attack channel where we mentioned above, we classify it and any similar future exploits as others.</p><h3 id="P3-Expected-privilege"><a href="#P3-Expected-privilege" class="headerlink" title="(P3) Expected privilege"></a>(P3) Expected privilege</h3><p>Root privilege is the ultimate goal of privilege escalation on Android platform, however, sometimes it does not need to be mandatory as some functions like camera and screenshot do not require root privilege to invoke. Gaining code execution in Android <em>System Server</em> or <em>Media Server</em> could also be considered as a successful exploitation under certain circumstance (Davi et al., 2010). Many exploits can help attacker gain root privilege directly. Nevertheless, there are some exploits targeting high privileges other than root, for example, the system user privilege, the shell privilege, privileges within sub-systems of the target device like baseband or trusted executable environment (TEE), etc.</p><h2 id="Technical-Perspectives"><a href="#Technical-Perspectives" class="headerlink" title="Technical Perspectives"></a>Technical Perspectives</h2><h3 id="T1-Attack-surface"><a href="#T1-Attack-surface" class="headerlink" title="(T1) Attack surface"></a>(T1) Attack surface</h3><p>Attack surface represents a set of interactions and components where an exploit takes advantage and initiates the attack routine. By observing various exploits, we summarize attack surfaces used by these exploits, furthermore we categorize those attack surfaces into 3 groups - they are remote attack surfaces, local attack surfaces, and physical attack surfaces. The remote attack surfaces and local attack surfaces represent different approaches that the attacker uses to interact with the target device. On the other hand, the local attack surfaces contain the components within the Android operating system where the exploit takes advantage to escalate privilege. It is worth mentioning that an exploit may have multiple attack surfaces from different categories to constitute a successful attack.</p><h4 id="T1-1-Physical-Attack-Surface"><a href="#T1-1-Physical-Attack-Surface" class="headerlink" title="(T1.1) Physical Attack Surface"></a>(T1.1) Physical Attack Surface</h4><p>Establishing USB connection between the attack machine and the target device is the first step for many exploitations. USB is the primary wired interface for Android devices to interact with other devices. In an active Android operating system, there is a service named ADB daemon (“adb”) standing by all the time to facilitate the command operation and data transmission through ADB channel. Once a trusted ADB connection has been set up, the attacker can deploy an exploit by either executing corresponding commands to install a crafted application, or starting a shell session to run an executive file with attack payload. For that reason, USB is treated as the most ubiquitous physical attack surface exposed to diverse exploits on Android platform. In addition to the USB, there are some other physical connection methods applicable for some Android devices and theoretically feasible to be the attack surface of exploitation, for example, the SD Card and the HDMI connection. However, until the date of this paper being drafted, there is no publicly released exploit found to use any physical connection method other than USB.</p><h4 id="T1-2-Remote-Client-side-Attack-Surface"><a href="#T1-2-Remote-Client-side-Attack-Surface" class="headerlink" title="(T1.2) Remote (Client-side) Attack Surface"></a>(T1.2) Remote (Client-side) Attack Surface</h4><p>The remote attack is always a very popular and attractive topic because it gets rid of physical restriction. Rather than a physical connection, the attacker could execute the exploit program over a computer network.<br>The web browser application is one of the major attack surfaces in remote attacks. One possible attack could be exercised by Document Object Model (DOM) manipulation through JavaScript. The malicious script injected by the attacker could dynamically modify the structure and content of current web page once loaded by the browser. In fact, due to the rich functionality of the browser application, there are a lot of opportunities for the attacker to explore the local attack surfaces from it. Among the existing Android exploits we surveyed, <em>WebKit Use-After-Free</em> is a typical browser attack which inserts a script into the space that has just been freed, and hereby achieves privilege escalation. Then it creates a remote shell window to allow the attacker to remotely control the target device.<br>Besides the browser, many web-powered applications on Android platform also have very high possibilities to be chosen as the attack surface during remote attacks. Most of the applications that work based on Internet service are implemented by making use of standardized web service APIs and libraries, for example, the SSL/TLS authentication and the embedded browser engine called <em>WebViews</em>. The components using standard WebViews libraries and APIs will very possibly reveal the potential attack surfaces. For example, in 2015, an exploit called <em>StageFright</em> has been found to take advantage of media previewing library on some Android devices. It can gain control of the victim’s device through a reverse shell by sending a crafted media file which contains malicious payload and then being previewed within victim’s device. A web-powered mobile application is selected to be the attack surface during the demonstration of StageFright exploitation.<br>Electronic mail (E-mail) client application is another potential attack surface for the remote attack. As most of the mainstream E-mail service providers allow users to attach any type of file in their messages, the attacker could insert malicious script into a document or media file and send to the victim through an E-mail message, then deliver an attack to the browser or other vulnerable applications to the victim’s device.</p><h4 id="T1-3-Local-Attack-Surface"><a href="#T1-3-Local-Attack-Surface" class="headerlink" title="(T1.3) Local Attack Surface"></a>(T1.3) Local Attack Surface</h4><p><strong>(T1.3.1) File System</strong>. Local attack surfaces represent the attack point initiated by a program or script which is already executing on the victim’s device. For most of the exploits programs, the local attack surface is the first step and a necessity of actual vulnerability exploitation. Here we summarize 6 different common attack surfaces in this category.<br>Due to the Unix lineage of the Android system, the file system is one of the most frequently mentioned attack surfaces to conduct the local attack. The file system defines ownership and permission for each file entry. Attackers will have a chance to exercise exploitation if there is no sufficient restriction being enforced for the file permission assignment. One typical file system attack is taking advantage of inadequate security implementation in <code>init.rc</code> file to exercise a symbolic link attack (Drake et al., 2014). By changing <code>/data/local</code> folder permission to make it writable by the user and shell group, the user can reboot the device and then set the <code>ro.kernel.qemu</code> value to 1 in <code>local.prop</code> file. As the result, the user of device obtains the root privilege. We will discuss the real application of the exploitation targeting Android file system in next technical perspective T3.</p><p><strong>(T1.3.2) Daemons.</strong> ADB and Zygote are two daemons most prevalently exploited by attackers. When we initiate an ADB session on Android devices, the ADB daemon (<code>adbd</code> process) starts running as the root user and then drops its privilege to the shell user before it gets ready to be used. However, in old versions of Android up to 2.2, the ADB daemon does not implement an adequate check to the return value of the <code>setuid</code> call at the moment of dropping privilege from root to the shell user. Similarly, the Zygote daemon also gives root user privilege to all the processes forked from it, and then drops privilege once the user who forks process from it has been confirmed. Since both daemons are originated from root user, they become popular attack surfaces to exercise an exploitation for root access. We will explain more about this process later in daemon abusing attack vector.</p><p><strong>(T1.3.3) System Calls.</strong> System calls constitute an important type of attack surface in the Android system. An attack can exercise by making use of the vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel of the Android system, invoking system calls with malicious data or arguments and then tampering the system kernel to attain higher privilege. For example, <em>TowelRoot / futex exploit</em> is one of the best-known exploits in early versions of the Android operating system. It takes advantage of code defects in <code>relock</code> and <code>requeue</code> functions defined in <code>futex.c</code> in the Linux kernel source code. When attackers running the exploit program, those vulnerable functions will be called with malicious arguments and in an inappropriate manner. As a result, the <code>addr_limit</code> value of the current thread has been modified and the user privilege of the current thread has been escalated correspondingly. Another exploit <code>libperf_event</code> targets on the <code>perf_swevent_init</code> function in the Linux kernel. It passes a negative integer as an argument of <code>perf_swevent_init</code> function to crash the current thread and then achieves arbitrary code execution to attain privilege for the attacker.</p><p><strong>(T1.3.4) Drivers.</strong> In the Android platform, drivers usually represent a bundle of libraries or modules that bridge the gap between user applications and a hardware or native system service. In fact, there are lots of drivers existing in the operating system of an actual Android device. We group these drivers into 3 types on the basis of their functionalities.<br>The first type of driver is called standard drivers (more of Linux side), which are ported from the Linux kernel. This type of drivers usually serves as enablers of the basic hardware, such as Bluetooth and audio. The attacker can migrate a driver vulnerability or issue residing in the Linux system to the Android platform. For example, there is an exploit called <em>dirtyCow</em> which is essentially found on Linux platform but later proved that works on the Android operating system, too. It makes use of race conditioning vulnerability in <code>tty</code> (controlling terminal) driver, turns the read-only mapping of a file to writable status and finally gains privilege.<br>Another type of driver is Android specified drivers, which are implemented to support the exclusive functionalities of the Android system on the basis of the Linux kernel. Many features of the Android system such as the Anonymous Shared Memory (<code>ashmem</code>), binder, logger, and power management, are all enabled by Android specific drivers. Drivers belonging to this category can be treated as attack surface to conduct exploitation. For instance, a famous exploit during the early stage of the Android history called <em>KillingInTheNameOf</em> and its variant <em>psneuter</em> exploit are all using <code>ashmem</code> driver as the local attack surface.<br>Last but not the least, the vendor drivers also play a key role in the local attack surface family. Due to the uneven quality of the drivers’ implementation by diverse hardware vendors, the APIs offered by vendor drivers often bring defects and therefore are used by attackers to conduct exploitation. Based on our findings, the first exploit that uses vendor driver as the attack surface is named <em>levitator</em> and released in 2011 (Drake et al., 2014). It takes advantage of the defect in APIs offered by PowerVR SGX chipset driver to corrupt the kernel memory and gain privilege. From then on, the exploits using vendor drivers as the primary local attack surface emerged quickly and reserved a significant proportion among all exploits since 2013.</p><h3 id="T2-Attack-vector"><a href="#T2-Attack-vector" class="headerlink" title="(T2) Attack vector"></a>(T2) Attack vector</h3><p>Attack vector represents the concrete attack method used by an exploit program to gain privilege. The pair of attack vector and attack surface depicts an attack model of exploitation. For some complex exploits, there may be more than one attack vectors existing during different phases of an attack. We summarize the attack vectors for different exploits according to the taxonomy of attack surface we made.</p><h4 id="T2-1-Daemon-Abusing"><a href="#T2-1-Daemon-Abusing" class="headerlink" title="(T2.1) Daemon Abusing"></a>(T2.1) Daemon Abusing</h4><p>As we mentioned previously, the ADB daemon (<code>adbd</code>) in Android system is designed to drop its privilege from the root to shell before itself being presented for user interaction. But unfortunately, the ADB daemon does not properly check the return value of <code>setuid</code> function in Android versions prior to 2.3, which leaves a chance of gaining root privilege by interrupting the privilege dropping process to attackers. In 2010, Sebastian Kraphmer found there is a threshold value specifying the maximum number of co-existing ADB processes that the Android system could normally accomplish the privilege dropping action (Drake et al., 2014). Once the threshold value being reached, the newly initiated ADB processes are presented to the user with root privilege. This kind of attack was later used in Sebastian’s exploit named <em>RageAgainstTheCage</em>. Thereafter, abusing ADB has been mentioned again in 2012 in <em>Z2 exploit</em>. By making use of security issues in ADB backup function on some Sony Xperia devices, the exploit program creates a race condition and injects a privileged symbolic link into the system - by doing so the read-only system properties could be tampered and eventually the ADB will run as root user.<br>Abusing Zygote process is another example of daemon abusing on Android device. Zygote serves as the father process in the Android system, where all Android applications are started by being forked from the Zygote process. However, this forking procedure has similar privilege assigning routine with ADB daemon. When a new process is forked by Zygote, the Zygote by default gives the newly generated process with root privilege and then drops its privilege if the new process is initiated by the local user. Some exploits, such as <em>Zimperlich / zygote jailbreak</em> and <em>Zysploit</em>, make use of the similar defects in Zygote that the privilege lowering stage can be bypassed once the number of processes under one specific application user ID (UID) has reached its maximum value. As the result, the upcoming processes forked by Zygote under same application UID will run as root user.</p><h4 id="T2-2-File-Permission-and-Symbolic-Link-Attack"><a href="#T2-2-File-Permission-and-Symbolic-Link-Attack" class="headerlink" title="(T2.2) File Permission and Symbolic Link Attack"></a>(T2.2) File Permission and Symbolic Link Attack</h4><p>File permission and symbolic link (symlink) attacks have been used in many exploits in Android version up to 4.1. During the Android booting up, an init function will be called to execute the commands listed in <code>init.rc</code> script. The initialization commands contain a couple of folder creation (<code>mkdir</code>) actions, changing permission (<code>chmod</code>) actions and changing owner (<code>chown</code>) actions. Attackers usually look for security issues from this initialization procedure, and then create a symlink within the space where they are going to set with higher privilege. By doing this, attackers are able to make protected directories user-writable and then they can overwrite the <code>local.prop</code> file and set ADB user to root.<br>As most of these exploits make use of security issues in the third-party customized system image rather than stock Android, the file permission and symlink attack exploits are overall brand specific or device model specific, for example, the <em>TacoRoot</em> for HTC models, <em>TwerkMyMoto</em> for Motorola models and <em>NachoRoot</em> for Asus models. This type of attack vectors has been mitigated since Android version 4.2 as Android added extra security semantics in the execution of <code>init</code> script to prevent the permission and file system from being exploited.</p><h4 id="T2-3-Shared-Memory-Remapping"><a href="#T2-3-Shared-Memory-Remapping" class="headerlink" title="(T2.3) Shared Memory Remapping"></a>(T2.3) Shared Memory Remapping</h4><p>As mentioned earlier, Android has its own shared memory subsystem called <code>ashmem</code>. Android offers a number of richer and simpler APIs to programmers for performance improvement by enabling developers to utilize shared memory wisely. Android system allows any user to create and map a region in shared memory, and then execute read and write actions in a very efficient manner. Unfortunately, the <code>ashmem</code> might also be used by the attacker to map and tamper the protected contents. Taking the exploit <em>KillingInTheNameOf</em> as example, due to the fact that system does not properly restrict local user to access the system properties space in early versions of the Android operating system like 2.x, the attacker could re-map the space where <code>local.prop</code> is located, and thereby change the <code>ro.secure</code> property to make the ADB process bypass the privilege dropping operation in future booting.</p><h4 id="T2-4-Memory-Corruption"><a href="#T2-4-Memory-Corruption" class="headerlink" title="(T2.4) Memory Corruption"></a>(T2.4) Memory Corruption</h4><p>Memory corruption is the attack vector that is commonly adopted for exploiting kernel and driver vulnerabilities. It occupies larger proportion among all available attack vectors for exploitation on the Android platform, especially after carrying a large scale of bug fixing and greatly strengthening Android security mechanism of Google since past few years ago. Memory corruption is a broad concept that describes all the approaches to alter the normal execution of the target device by memory manipulation. Many typical memory corruption methods like stack overflow, integer overflow, dereference of the null pointer and format error, could be found in available Android exploits.<br>To conduct an attack, the attacker usually chooses a privileged process as the target and then carries out memory attack by all means to crash the target process. Once the memory manipulation has been successfully achieved, the attacker may have a chance to execute arbitrary code on behalf of the privileged process and thereby gain soft root on the target device. For example, the <em>Use-After-Free Remote Code Execution on Webkit</em> uses null point dereference as attack vector to exploit; <em>GingerBreak</em> crashes the <code>vold</code> daemon by feeding a negative integer to it to cause an integer overflow; and <em>zergRush</em> invokes a <code>libsysutils.so</code> function with the wrong number of arguments passing in, leading to a Return Oriented Programming (ROP) chain to obtain soft root.<br>As the memory corruption is possible to occur at the moment of every function invocation during the execution of Android native program, there is no lack of memory corruption in our exploit survey results. It is hard to prevent memory corruption completely when compared with other types of attack vectors.</p><h4 id="T2-5-Remote-Shell-Control"><a href="#T2-5-Remote-Shell-Control" class="headerlink" title="(T2.5) Remote Shell Control"></a>(T2.5) Remote Shell Control</h4><p>All the attack vectors we list in previous paragraphs are corresponding to local attack. In addition to local attack, the attacker also has to own an extra pair of attack vector and surface to conduct a remote attack. Setting up a remote shell control is the most commonly used attack vector to conduct a remote attack. A remote shell control is not initiated by the attacker but triggered by the user of the target device - usually in an unaware manner. To prepare a remote attack, the attacker needs to implement the payload code which is able to start an ADB shell through the reverse TCP or HTTP connection to the attacker’s machine, and then embed the code into the exploit program. Thereafter the attacker just needs to wait until the payload is triggered, followed by a reverse shell launched by the target device.<br>Gaining remote shell control does not bring the attacker with a root superior privilege. However, it links a remote circumstance up with local attack methods and thereby makes exploitation without physical connection possible. In our survey, we can find the presence of remote shell control in all remote exploits, for example, the <em>Use-After-Free Remote Code Execution on Webkit</em> and <em>StageFright</em>.</p><h4 id="T2-6-Others"><a href="#T2-6-Others" class="headerlink" title="(T2.6) Others"></a>(T2.6) Others</h4><p>Among the exploits we found during this survey, there are some outdated, unrepresentative or undisclosed attack vectors. For example, an exploit named <em>StumpRoot</em> doesn’t provide any disclosure of technical details or source code to the public. The attack vector used by exploit <em>Volez</em> is outdated and unrepresentative when compared with other ones. In this paper, we classify those uncommon and unknown attack vectors as others.</p><h3 id="T3-Vulnerable-target"><a href="#T3-Vulnerable-target" class="headerlink" title="(T3) Vulnerable target"></a>(T3) Vulnerable target</h3><p>Vulnerable target describes the source of vulnerability where the attacker targets. An exploit could only be designed and implemented once the vulnerable target is confirmed. The mitigations of Android exploits are tailored to the vulnerable target correspondingly. In this paper, we present 5 different types of vulnerable targets to cover the existing cases of Android exploitation.</p><h4 id="T3-1-File-System"><a href="#T3-1-File-System" class="headerlink" title="(T3.1) File System"></a>(T3.1) File System</h4><p>The file system as a type of vulnerable target, is the most common focus of the file permission and symbolic link attack (refer to the technical perspective T2-2). All Android exploits targeting file system are achieved by conducting file permission and symbolic link attack. The ultimate goal of an exploit targeting Android file system is to change the ownership of file for either content tampering or illegal execution. For example, changing the value of <code>ro.kernel.qemu</code> to 1 in the <code>local.prop</code> file.<br>Most of the vulnerabilities relating to this type of Android exploit are caused by the vendors’ customization in Android, therefore the exploit attacking Android file system usually varies with devices’ manufacturer and hardware configuration. The file system exploits used to be a common type of exploits on Android platform until the Android version 4.2 when the <code>O_NOFOLLOW</code> semantics has been introduced to prevent the symbolic link attack (Google, 2017e). Since version 4.3, Android enforces the SELinux model to regulate all permission involved activities within Android system.</p><h4 id="T3-2-System-Component"><a href="#T3-2-System-Component" class="headerlink" title="(T3.2) System Component"></a>(T3.2) System Component</h4><p>We group all the Google-implemented components located in middleware layer, framework layer and application layer of Android architecture as system components. We use the term system exploits to represent exploits targeting vulnerabilities from system components. The Android components which provide either interface to native level development or user space access are often exploited by attackers. For example, the system services, native libraries, daemons, and Android shared memory (<code>ashmem</code>). The first ever publicly released exploit program on Android platform is a system exploit called <em>Volez</em>, which manipulates the system recovery service to place superuser binary into the system executable directory on victim’s device. There are some other milestones where exploits are categorized as system exploits, such as the <em>KillingInTheNameOf</em> that takes advantage of ashmem access issue to gain root access, the <em>RageAgainstTheCage</em> that targets vulnerabilities in Android <em>adbd</em> daemon to achieve privilege escalation; and the <em>StageFright</em> that can exploit the library with the same name in Android system to obtain high privilege in silence.<br>Compared with other 4 groups of vulnerable targets, the system components’ vulnerabilities are relatively easier to be fixed by Android. The mitigation of system exploits usually comes with a timely Android security patch or an operating system update.</p><h4 id="T3-3-Linux-Kernel"><a href="#T3-3-Linux-Kernel" class="headerlink" title="(T3.3) Linux Kernel"></a>(T3.3) Linux Kernel</h4><p>We use Linux kernel to represent those vulnerable targets located in kernel layer components other than the file system, which includes Linux kernel drivers, process manager, and network controller. Unlike the Android system vulnerabilities, Linux kernel vulnerabilities are mostly found from the source code of the Linux kernel rather than Google’s implementation in Android. Therefore, many vulnerable targets that exploit other operating systems in Linux family can also be migrated to Android platform. The exploitation targeting Linux kernel on Android platform has been firstly introduced in an exploit program named <em>exploid</em> in 2010. The <em>exploid</em> selects <code>init</code> daemon in Linux kernel as the target, exploits a vulnerability by initiating memory corruption and gains root privilege from the daemon.<br>Because the root user is designed as a part of privilege architecture in the Linux kernel, it is difficult for the components running on the Android platform to prevent privilege escalation initiated from the kernel exploits. Furthermore, due to the fact that the evolution of Linux kernel is usually slower than the evolution of Android, it makes it harder in Android to identify and fix kernel vulnerabilities within a short period. As a consequence, the Linux Kernel exploit usually works on multiple continuous version of Android systems.</p><h4 id="T3-4-Vendor-Driver"><a href="#T3-4-Vendor-Driver" class="headerlink" title="(T3.4) Vendor Driver"></a>(T3.4) Vendor Driver</h4><p>The exploits in this category target hardware abstraction layer (HAL) implementation. The history of vendor driver exploits could be dated back to 2010. <em>levitator</em> is the first Android exploit that conducts an attack on devices with specific hardware configuration containing PowerVR SGX chipset. As the Android experienced a rapid growth in the past few years, the great flexibility and diversity in hardware configuration on Android platform makes vendor driver exploits one of the major type of the exploitation.<br>Vendor driver exploits exclusively have 2 advantages. Firstly, compared with TEE exploits, vendor driver exploits can escalate privilege to system or root level and return to the user control directly; meanwhile, unlike the kernel exploits or system exploits, vendor driver exploits make use of vulnerabilities caused by the add-ons from various vendors rather than Android implementation, which means Android cannot exhaustively and effectively fix all the issues via its version update and hence may not be able to prevent from any induced exploitation in short time. Therefore, for the foreseeable future, we believe that the vendor driver exploits will still be the majority of new exploits.</p><h4 id="T3-5-Trusted-Execution-Environment"><a href="#T3-5-Trusted-Execution-Environment" class="headerlink" title="(T3.5) Trusted Execution Environment"></a>(T3.5) Trusted Execution Environment</h4><p>Attacking trusted execution environment (TEE) is a novel attempt at privilege escalation. In 2015, a researcher called laginimaineb published a series of blog articles and the proof-of-concept source code to explain his idea to gain TEE level privilege from <em>Qualcomm TrustZone</em>, which marks the first time that the TEE was exploited (laginimaineb, 2015).<br>Compared with exploits targeting other types of vulnerable targets, the TEE exploits have a very strict requirement but low practicability. Sometimes TEE exploits require a device flashed with customized ROM or that has Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) disabled. However, the outcome of a successful exploitation is just the privilege within TEEOS module rather than the root user. The attacker may not be able to attain full control of the victim device, instead, the attacker could gain access to the credential data like fingerprint or iris image, which is very sensitive as well. Currently TEE exploits are still in the theoretical stage, however, it is an inspiration to the future exploitation when security mechanism of the Android system become too strong to obtain root directly.</p><h1 id="Survey"><a href="#Survey" class="headerlink" title="Survey"></a>Survey</h1><p>We conduct a survey of publicly released Android exploits from multiple sources and we find 63 exploits covering all Android versions up to 7.0. By reading their descriptions, searching for available source codes and studying correspond- ing vulnerabilities, we collect rich details of these 63 exploits. In this study, we summarize all the key details that are useful for upcoming analysis, and we organize them into a table. The table below shows the complete collection of all 63 exploits including their names, authors, release years, attack details, details of corresponding recorded vulnerabilities, affected devices &amp; Android versions and our evaluation outcome. In order to distinguish an exploit from the others and facilitate our analysis, we focus on practical and technical perspectives of Android exploitation and we select 3 classification criteria from the taxonomy we proposed in the previous section.

For convenience, we call those exploits using app execution channel as “app exploits”, those exploits triggered by shell scripts through the physical connection as “shell exploits”, and those exploits executed by embedded payload code via remote environment will be notated as “remote exploits”. Figure below demonstrates the distribution of exploits according to execution channels.</p><p><strong>App Exploit.</strong> There are 19 exploits coming with a standalone APK file, reserving 30.6% among all exploits in our collection. All those exploits, except <em>GingerBreak</em> and <em>TowelRoot</em>, could only work on devices in a specific hardware configuration or in some exact models. The <em>GingerBreak</em> takes advantage of vulnerabilities in <code>vold</code> daemon and has been fixed in updates of Android version 2.3.4 and 3.0 in 2011, which are considered as a pretty early stage of Android history. Another exploit named <em>TowelRoot</em> used to be popular due to its long list of supporting device; however, its functionality to successfully gain root privilege stops at Android version 4.4.4, which is another outdated system nowadays (Wikipedia, 2017b). Therefore, we can optimistically conclude that most of the Android devices in the market are safe against existing APK exploits.</p><p><strong>Shell Exploit.</strong> Shell exploits take the majority of our collection according to the figure below. We totally collect 37 shell exploits in this survey, which comprise over 59% of the entire collection. Among these 37 shell exploits, three exploits (<em>Defy republic init_runit</em>, <em>TwerkMyMoto</em> and <em>Pie / vold asec</em>) come with Java source codes that the attacker has to compile and compress them into an executable JAR file to conduct the exploitation; three exploits targeting the file system (<em>TacoRoot</em>, <em>NachoRoot</em> and <em>TPSparklyRoot</em>) are provided with an ADB shell script rather than executable binaries; and the 31 exploits left are all C codes which the attacker needs to configure the project with specified hardware architecture (e.g. arm64 or x86)(Wikipedia, 2017a) and build with Android Native Development Kit (NDK) to generate executable binaries. According to the information listed in the table above, those 37 exploits cover all Android system versions up to 6.0 and most of the mainstream device models. Therefore in the case of all three pre-requisites (refer to P1), practical perspective P2) of shell execution have been compromised to the attacker, an Android device will have a great probability to be successfully exploited if those shell exploits have been put into a proper combination and executed.</p><div align="center"><br><div style="width:45%;margin-top:-30px;"><br><img src="/2018/07/01/exploit-survey/type_distribution.jpg" title="Type Distribution of Exploits"><br></div></div><p><strong>Remote Exploit.</strong> Other than local USB connection, ADB also provides developers with access to an unprivileged interaction through a remote shell. In our collection, 9.7% of exploits are classified as remote exploits. There are two exploits targeting the Android Stagefright library vulnerabilities, three exploits targeting the Android Webkit library vulnerabilities, and one exploit attaining root privilege by taking advantage of a Linux kernel vulnerability. Taking <em>StageFright Remote Code Execution</em> (hereafter refer to <em>StageFright</em> for short) as an example, it is a typical remote exploit that the attacker can gain root privilege of the target device by hosting a crafted web page containing media payload source code. The exploit will be triggered automatically and executed once the user starts browsing the crafted web page, and in the end, the exploit will initiate a remote shell process to the attack machine to pass the control of the target device to the attacker.</p><div align="center"><br><div style="width:90%;margin-top:-30px;"><br><img src="/2018/07/01/exploit-survey/exploit_vector_growth_w_legend.png"><br>Growth of Exploits (Per Attack Vector)<br></div></div><h2 id="Attack-Vector"><a href="#Attack-Vector" class="headerlink" title="Attack Vector"></a>Attack Vector</h2><p>Classification by attack vector provides an intuitive perception to the methodology of Android exploitation. Based on our taxonomy, we summarize attack vectors into 6 different categories. We demonstrate the growth of exploits in different attack modes throughout the history of Android system in the figure above.<br><strong>Daemon Abusing Exploit.</strong> In this survey, we find four exploits that gain privilege by abusing daemons running on the Android system. Among the four daemon abusing exploits, the <em>RageAgainstTheCage</em> and <em>Z2 Root exploit</em> exhaust the ADB daemon (“adbd”) to interrupt the privilege dropping procedure of all future generated ADB sessions; the other two exploits - <em>Zimperlich / zygote jailbreak</em> and <em>Zysploit</em> impose similar routine to the Zygote daemon as the Zygote daemon also has privilege lowering mechanism while generating new process. The issues of these two daemons have been progressively fixed since the Android system version 2.3 was released at the end of 2010. According to our observation, the growth of this kind of attack has not appeared anymore in 2012 and afterward.<br><strong>File Permission &amp; Symbolic Link Exploit.</strong> File permission and symbolic link attacks are also known as <em>permission attack</em> or <em>symlink attack</em> elsewhere. There are 8 exploits gaining root privilege by initiating a permission attack. Except for the <em>mempodroid / mempodipper exploit</em> that makes use of a loophole from the Android file permission to directly modify process memory file, all the remaining 6 exploits take advantage of poor security mechanism in critical directories or files, create a symbolic link to either “local.prop” or “uevent_helper” and then tamper the privilege assignment of the ADB shell service. As a result, a successful exploit will return user an ADB session running as root user. The permission mechanism on Android file system is mature, safe and well organized. However, the attacker could still find a flaw to exercise attack due to the negligence or defect within the implementation of Android device manufacturer. Owing to the improvement of Android security mechanism and enhancement in security awareness from the device vendors, it is rare to see new file permission and symbolic link attack in recent years.<br><strong>Shared Memory Exploit.</strong> Similar to daemons’ abusing, shared memory remapping is another common approach to gain privilege in early versions of the Android system. We find two exploits that gain privilege by attacking the Android shared memory (<code>ashmem</code>)<br>– <em>KillingInTheNameOf</em> and <em>psneuter ashmem exploit</em>. Both of them achieve privilege escalation by remapping the shared memory region and tampering the value of user ID assigned to ADB console. The ashmem vulnerability could be fixed by adding a number of authentication checks at the moment that the shared memory is accessed by any app or process from user space. In fact, the relevant ashmem vulnerability has been fixed in very short time. The number of shared memory attack cease to grow since 2011.<br><strong>Memory Corruption Exploit.</strong> Memory corruption is the major attack vector throughout the history of the Android exploitation. Memory corruption exploits reserve over the half of all available exploits since the very beginning phase of the Android exploitation. Moreover, the memory corruption even becomes the only feasible local attack vector to gain privilege in 2015 and 2016. It is also worth noting that besides the quantitative growth, the diversity of memory corruption methods has been greatly enriched as well. During the early years, the memory corruption technique only covered format error (e.g. <em>exploid</em>) and null pointer dereference (e.g. <em>Use-After-Free Webkit</em>). But now, the memory corruption exploitation on the Android platform almost covers all the memory manipulation on conventional platforms, such as return-oriented programming. As it is impossible to completely prevent memory corruption in native level development for Android platform, we believe that memory corruption exploits will continue to play the primary role within Android exploit family in future.<br><strong>Remote Shell Control Exploit.</strong> Compared with other attack modes, remote shell control usually requires the user of the target device, on purpose or unknowingly, to trigger the attack process. Conducting remote shell control attack could indirectly create an interface for the attacker and convert a remote attack to a local attack for further privilege escalation. For that reason, the remote shell control is usually executed together with a certain local attack vector to complete the privilege escalation operation for the attacker in distance. Remote shell control attack has a great advantage in camouflage and anonymity, which are two important features of a good exploitation. In this survey, we find 6 exploits that make use of this attack vector to achieve remote attack throughout the history of Android exploits. As mentioned earlier in practical perspective P2, a successful remote shell control exploits requires the attacker to be under the same network with the victim’s device and moreover to know the IP address of the victim’s device prior to generating exploitation payload. Due to those reasons, even the growth of remote shell control exploits has never ceased since they were firstly introduced in 2010, the complicated execution procedure and strict conditions make the remote shell control still not yet a mainstream attack vector when compared with memory corruption.</p><div align="center"><br><div style="width:90%;margin-top:-30px;"><br><img src="/2018/07/01/exploit-survey/exploit_target_growth_w_legend.png"><br>Growth of Exploits (Per Attack Target)<br></div></div><h2 id="Vulnerable-Target"><a href="#Vulnerable-Target" class="headerlink" title="Vulnerable Target"></a>Vulnerable Target</h2><p>Classification by vulnerable target could tell us where the exploitation originates. Moreover, we can gain an insight of the Android exploits in defense perspective by grouping the exploits by their vulnerable targets and analyzing the quantitative trend throughout the history of the Android system. According to the taxonomy in the previous section, we differentiate the vulnerable targets of all exploits into five groups of components within software part of the Android device. We depict the quantitative trends of exploits with different vulnerable targets in the figure above.<br><strong>File System Exploit.</strong> We find six cases of file system exploitation among 63 Android exploits, and all six file system exploits use file permission &amp; symbolic link attack to gain privilege. By analyzing each of those 6 exploits, we notice that the device manufacturers’ implementation is the root cause of the exploitation. We find that all of them are applicable to a small range of device models under the same brand, and the places where exploitation takes place are either the initialization scripts or the privileged factory software (e.g. backup &amp; restore app). The history of file system exploits starts in 2011 when an exploit for some specific HTC models named “<em>TacoRoot</em>“ has been released. In early 2012, the author of <em>TacoRoot</em>, Justin Case, released a variant called <em>NachoRoot</em>, which uses similar attack but is designed for a different set of device models. Shortly after that, another similar exploit <em>TPSparkyRoot</em> also has been published within the same forum, targeting same devices as <em>NachoRoot</em>. The other three exploits, <em>LG Sprite software backup / LGPwn exploit</em>, <em>TwerkMyMoto</em> and <em>WeakSauce</em>, have subsequently been released between 2013 and 2014 by Justin Case. At the same time, both Google and device manufacturers have greatly improved the security mechanism of Android devices. As the result, new file system exploits have ceased to appear since 2015.<br><strong>System Component Exploit.</strong> System implementation is the second largest exploit target. There are a total of 16 system exploits released in the Android history, reserving over 25% among all surveyed Android exploits. Except for <em>Volez</em> which targets system recovery service and is counted as a special case for the early Android versions, all the remaining 15 system exploits are targeting native libraries, daemons or ashmem. Two exploits, <em>KillingInTheNameOf</em> and <em>psneuert</em>, take advantage of ashmem access issue and were published in 2011. Six exploits use daemons as their targets. The daemons which have been abused for exploitation include <code>vold</code>, <code>zygote</code> and <code>adbd</code>. Furthermore, there are seven exploits that conduct attacks by invoking system calls to specific libraries. The targeted vulnerable libraries include <em>Webkit</em>, <em>libsysutils</em>, <em>StageFright</em> and media server libraries.<br>It is noticeable to mention that the ashmem exploits only appear in the new exploit list of 2011 due to the quick fix. Considering the limited number of daemons that are accessible by user space processes, the growth of exploits caused by daemon abusing was suspended in 2014. Starting from 2015, all newly released system exploits are achieved by memory corruption against native libraries. There are a large number of libraries in the Android system implementation and each of them provides unique functionality and interface. Compared with ashmem exploits and daemon exploits which target only one or a few number of vulnerabilities, protecting the libraries from memory corruption attack is a more challenging work for Android.<br><strong>Linux Kernel Exploit.</strong> Starting from the first Linux kernel exploit “<em>exploid</em>“ which is released in 2010, the number of Linux kernel exploits (hereafter referred to as kernel exploits for short) keeps growing every year. In this survey, we collect 11 kernel exploits with their release date spanning from 2010 to 2016. From the static analysis made on those 11 exploits, we find there is only one kernel exploit called <em>prctl_vma_exploit</em> (2016) that is exclusive to the Android platform. All the other 10 kernel exploits are created as variants and share same vulnerabilities and attack routines with corresponding exploits for Linux operating system. Moreover, our analysis shows that kernel libraries and driver interfaces are the most frequently chosen vulnerable targets by Linux kernel exploits. Attackers often make use of flaws in input validation to create memory corruption while invoking kernel services. We also find that many Android exploits with long life cycle and wide support to different devices are kernel exploits. For example, the <em>TowelRoot</em> declares to be able to root all devices installed with Android version up to 4.4; and <em>PingPongRoot</em> could easily root over 100 models of latest device models at that time like Samsung S6 / S6 Edge and HTC One.<br><strong>Vendor Driver Exploit.</strong> There are 25 vendor driver exploits being included in our survey. We find that all vendor driver exploits are achieved by memory corruption except for the <em>StumpRoot</em> exploit (2013) which does not have enough details disclosed. In addition, we also find that vendor driver exploits usually come in a group to achieve the maximum effort and compatibility. For example, in 2012, an exploit making use of Samsung driver has been published by “alephzain”. It is essentially named <em>Exynos Abuse</em> but later changed to <em>Sam exploit</em> when it is merged with some other vendor driver exploits written by the same author in 2013. The new bundle of various vendor driver exploits has been published as a one-click app on XDA forum with the name “<em>framaroot</em>“. According to author’s statement, the <em>framaroot</em> has integrated 12 different vendor driver exploits by 2014, covering over 450 device models from multiple brands (Alephzain, 2013).<br><strong>Trusted Execution Environment Exploit.</strong> We find five TEE exploits during this survey. There are four of “laginimaineb” <em>Qualcomm TrustZone</em> exploits and 1 Huawei TEE exploit named <em>Mate7 TrustZone exploit</em> in our survey collection. By reading the authors’ instructions of those exploits and analyzing their source code, we find that all of them can only achieve limited code execution with specific TEE level privilege, rather than flashing superuser binary or returning a root shell to the attacker. Therefore, in the current stage, TEE exploits still have obvious disadvantage in practicability and convenience when compared with others.</p><p><strong><em>As we mentioned in our taxonomy, we define those exploits with outdated, unrepresentative or undisclosed attack vectors as others.

&lt;p&gt;The Android operating system has been dominating the mobile device market in recent years. Although Android has actively strengthened its security mechanisms and fixed a great number of vulnerabilities as its version evolves, new vulnerabilities still keep emerging. Vulnerability exploitation is a common way to achieve privilege escalation on Android systems. In order to provide a holistic and comprehensive understanding of the exploits, we conduct a survey of publicly available 63 exploits for Android devices. Based on the analysis of the collected real-world exploits, we construct a taxonomy on Android exploitation and present the similarities/differences and strength/weakness of different types of exploits.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<img src="/2018/06/24/understanding_blockchain/cover.png"><p>Blockchain is a game changer in nowaday’s information technology and financial industry. Since 2008 that Nakamoto invented the concept of blockchain together with a cryptocurrency called “Bitcoin”, The topic of blockchain has been inundated with the fanaticism of cryptocurrencies’ enthusiasts in recent years. People expect this new technology to bring a revolution to the entire industry and thereby grab the opportunity to expand and strengthen their business. So in this essay let’s discuss about the nature of blockchain technology. In this article, I will share my own understanding of the nature of blockchain and my interpretation of “blockchain phenomenon” from the perspective of game theory.<a id="more"></a></p><h3 id="What-exactly-the-Blockchain-is"><a href="#What-exactly-the-Blockchain-is" class="headerlink" title="What exactly the Blockchain is?"></a>What exactly the Blockchain is?</h3><p>Let’s be straight forward — the blockchain, without the consideration of cryptocurrency, is just a methodology which provides an immutable distributed ledger to store the data without concerns of trust and malicious data tampering.</p><blockquote><p>Blockchain is a stunning solution to build trust in a trustless environment.</p></blockquote><p>The nature of blockchain is to store data and present the data in form of a structure called “ledger”. If you have some basic background of computer science or engineering, you can easily imagine it as a special “linked list” in which we learnt from the data structure course in college. Of course, only a ledger can’t attract so many people’s attention. The real innovative part of blockchain technology is the application of complex cryptographic algorithm to make the ledger immutable once it has been formed, as well as the all the participators don’t need to trust each others to maintain the data on the ledger.</p><div align="center"><br><div style="width:80%;margin-top:-30px;"><br><img src="/2018/06/24/understanding_blockchain/merkel.png"><br>A Merkle tree showing how a root hash value is calculated from 4 different data entity<br>(picture cited from user input on bitcoin.stackexchange.com)<br></div></div><p>The core of the cryptographic application in blockchain could be summarized into two parts:</p><p>(1) the first part of cryptographic application is “Merkle Hash Tree”, which guarantees the integration the data in either transactions or blocks by a explicit hash value, in another word, any slight change made in the data in a transaction or a block could be easily spot out by anybody by validating it against the hash value, which is usually publicly stored in elsewhere within the same transaction or block. I won’t explain the details of merkle tree here, as I am not a good instructor to teach those theories. Just need to notice that, the merkle hash tree achieves the immutability of the ledger of blockchain.</p><p>(2) Digital Signature is the second core cryptographic usage in blockchain. Digital signature is an application to the famous asymmetric encryption scheme called “public-private key pair”. With the digital signature of one participate ‘A’ which is signed by his/her private key, all the other participators are able to prove the authenticity of the data produced by ‘A’ by verifying his/her public key without needs to know anything more. The digital signature offers non-repudiation feature to the blockchain. The most commonly adopted cryptography scheme for digital signature includes RSA algorithms with key length not less than 1024 bits, and ECC (Elliptic-curve cryptography) with prime size not less than 192 bits.</p><h3 id="Blockchain-a-replacement-of-database"><a href="#Blockchain-a-replacement-of-database" class="headerlink" title="Blockchain: a replacement of database?"></a>Blockchain: a replacement of database?</h3><p>Let’s revise from the previous section, a blockchain, to make it simple, is a data recording mechanism with features of decentralization, immutability and un-repudiation.</p><blockquote><p>Blockchain is a data recording mechanism with features of decentralization, immutability and un-repudiation.</p></blockquote><p>Blockchain integrates those stunning features into one solution and brings to nowadays industry with a concise implementation. However, when businesses consider whether to adopt it, they have to calculate the cost and benefit carefully.</p><p>It is undeniable that the blockchain has so many great features that are possibly fixing the “pain point” of today’s business. But we also have to notice the shortage of the adoption of blockchain, such as the cost to build up infrastructure, performance issue of blockchain, data redundancy, and etc. The payoff of blockchain to most of businesses nowadays, may not always be positive.</p><blockquote><p>The payoff of blockchain to most of businesses nowadays may not always be positive.</p></blockquote><p>So now let’s think about a question — is blockchain a replacement of database? The answer may be no, at least not a simple replacement to replace traditional database.</p><p>In fact, despite of there are always voices blaming that the performance of nowadays database solution is not sufficient to satisfy the needs of big data storage, the traditional database solution still has great advantage in performance when it is compared with blockchain solution.</p><h3 id="Renew-our-Perception-to-Blockchain-through-Game-Theory"><a href="#Renew-our-Perception-to-Blockchain-through-Game-Theory" class="headerlink" title="Renew our Perception to Blockchain through Game Theory"></a>Renew our Perception to Blockchain through Game Theory</h3><div align="center"><br><div style="width:35%;margin-top:-30px;margin-bottom:-30px"><br><img src="/2018/06/24/understanding_blockchain/john_nash.jpeg"><br></div><br>John Nash, the inventor of Game Theory, Nobel Memorial Prize winner in economic sciences in 1994 and the inspiration of a well-known film “Beautiful Mind” (picture cited from Wikipedia)<br></div><p><br><br>Let’s don’t be discouraged after hearing some voices like “blockchain is not suitable to your business”. Everything in this world has its pros and cons, especially for those cutting edge technology. What we need to do is just to renew of perception to the blockchain technology — let’s understand blockchain all over again from another perspective.</p><p>Take the very first application of blockchain — “Bitcoin” as an instance. There are so many fans of bitcoin around the world, maybe you are one of them also. So do ask a question to yourself: why you love bitcoin? Let’s see if your reason are included in the list below or not.</p><ul><li>Financial investment, as I don’t want to put all my eggs into one basket, where the basket maybe a bank account or a currency.</li><li>Transparency, all the circulation of bitcoin are public and it is not issued by any government or central bank — so no chance for any government to manipulate the exchange rate.</li><li>Anonymity, bitcoin provides perfect anonymity when a person transact it online, you don’t need to concern of credit card fraud or phone fraud caused by personal information leakage.</li><li>Enthusiasm to the new thing, this is the last factor but not the least, because sometimes it is the most direct motivation of people to gain touch of bitcoin.</li></ul><p>You will find the top 3 benefits of blockchain are unique, innovative and currently irreplaceable by any other solution. Actually, those 3 features are the origin that make blockchain compromises in performance and data-redundancy. Especially the “proof-of-work” consensus protocol used in bitcoin, is a nightmare for the industry because it is extremely computational power inefficient.</p><p>By applying the game theory, for an individual player or cryptocurrency investor, the eco-system of bitcoin is brilliant as it has a clear Nash equilibrium for all honest participators, which is to make correct transaction, spend unspent bitcoin, honestly mine new block and verify other people’s actions— to contribute to the stability, sustainability and healthy operation of bitcoin eco-system.</p><div align="center"><br><div style="width:80%;margin-top:-30px;margin-bottom:-30px;"><br><img src="/2018/06/24/understanding_blockchain/maersk.jpeg"><br></div><br>IBM has set up partnership with Maersk Line in building a blockchain system to bring revolution to existing global shipping line industry (picture cited from Daily Cargo News)</div><p><br><br>Just like every coin has two sides, the businesses may not buy story of bitcoin-like blockchain solutions. What business world cares are privacy, data security, business efficiency, and a number of other benefits which could transform to the capability of financial income.</p><p>Privacy is very important to the business since the blockchain makes all transaction publicly transparent. Unfortunately, bitcoin, at least at the moment it was invented, doesn’t come with a perfect solution to protect user’s privacy. Another issue it the performance and power efficiency, the “proof-of-work” consensus used in bitcoin is not efficient and wastes a lot of computational power as price to achieve the data consistency throughout the network. Even there are some other consensus being invented in recent years, like “proof-of-stake” or “practical byzantine fault tolerance”, they mitigates performance concern but introduced some other issues such as fairness, trust and privacy.</p><p>Like what we mentioned previously, building up the infrastructure for blockchain system is costly, maintaining the blockchain ledger in a distributed network is another big challenge due to the data redundancy and high demand of computational performance. We are gratified to see some pioneers in traditional industry, like Maersk, Walmart and JD, have started adopting blockchain with business-oriented improvement in past a few years, and we believe the blockchain technology is just at the beginning stage of its lifecycle.</p><p><em>Cover image for Blockchain Technologies is cited from The Equinix Blog</em></p><p><strong><em>This article is also published on Medium with its title as <a href="https://medium.com/@mark.meng/consensus-in-blockchain-an-interpretation-from-game-theorys-perspective-2fc291f9e23b" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Blockchain: an Interpretation from Game Theory’s Perspective”</a></em></strong></p>]]></content>

Restaurants, as a typical and important business tightly connected with people’s daily life, are often treated as an indicator of local economic scale and resident income, reflecting people’s quality of life in that region. However, there are no previous studies unveiling the real factors that influence the number of restaurants in a region during the last few decades when the total number of restaurants in the USA ever experienced the greatest growth. In this project, we collect data from the largest restaurant review website in the USA named “Yelp” and a demographic information website “City-Data”, make use of statistical models and thereby summarize the result obtained from statistical analysis tools. <a id="more"></a> Eight factors have been proved to be the significant variables that have a linear relationship with the number of restaurants in an area defined by ZIP code. We interpret these eight factors under the social circumstance of the USA and analyse the reason behind. Last but not least, some suggestions have been provided to those people who plan to open a restaurant in USA to help them make a decision on location choosing.</p><h1 id="Background-amp-Objective"><a href="#Background-amp-Objective" class="headerlink" title="Background &amp; Objective"></a>Background &amp; Objective</h1><p>Restaurant is a typical and important business which is tightly connected with people’s daily life and accurately reflects local economic vitality and residents’ income. According to a statistics done by NDP, there are over 616 thousands restaurants opening in the United States and 7 percent increase in total number every year. People always prefer to live in a region with sufficient dining business, therefore it provides great opportunity and motivation to investors to open a restaurant. However, the location choosing is one of the most critical things for an investor to consider. The population, economy, security and other demographic factors of an area may affect the customers’ behavior and consumption, and thereby impact the return of restaurant business. In this project, we are going to make use of the data from the largest dining information website named “Yelp” and one biggest demographic data website in US called “city-data.com”, build an analytic model and then discover the potential demographic factors that may influence the number of restaurant business in a specific region in US. Our finding in this project could not only unveil the connection between demographic data and the economic scale of dining industry in USA, but also provide suggestions to those potential restaurant owners to choose a good location to open their business.</p><h1 id="Implementation"><a href="#Implementation" class="headerlink" title="Implementation"></a>Implementation</h1><h2 id="Data-Selection"><a href="#Data-Selection" class="headerlink" title="Data Selection"></a>Data Selection</h2><p>Our project goal is to find out the correlation between restaurants and attributes of a location. We selected yelp data set as our source of information of restaurants in USA. The yelp restaurant data set is provided by the USA based restaurant review site YELP. It includes six main object types, business, review, user and others. It has 2.2M reviews and 591K tips provided by 552K users for 77K businesses, along with 566K business attributes, e.g. Opening hours, ambiance, parking availability. The data was collected from mainly Nevada and Arizona.<br>The data set is available for download and already in processed format.

From there, we performed several commands to calculate some useful statistics of the restaurants in each zip code region, for example the average rating, rating variance, highest rating and so on.<br>The city data is crawled from web sites and stored in .csv file separated by commas. The city data was also imported into the same database. We used zip code as identifier and joined city data together with the yelp data set.

One of the most direct interpretations for this factor is that the renters may not have time to cook, or they have no sufficient cooking facilities in their rented house. They are the group of people who provide the demand for restaurants.<br>On the other hand, cities with a large number of renters are generally considered as big cities, which bring with a high living standard and large population. Hence the number of restaurants is supposed to be large. </p><h2 id="Factor-2-Males-Number"><a href="#Factor-2-Males-Number" class="headerlink" title="Factor 2 - Males Number"></a>Factor 2 - Males Number</h2><p>One of the interpretations for this factor is that more males implies larger population and hence higher consuming demand for food and dining business. </p><h2 id="Factor-3-Number-of-Single-Parents-Households"><a href="#Factor-3-Number-of-Single-Parents-Households" class="headerlink" title="Factor 3 - Number of Single Parents Households"></a>Factor 3 - Number of Single Parents Households</h2><p>Generally speaking, comparing with other types of families, single-parent families are more likely to have limited financial resources to cover their life expenses, especially the single-mother households. According to a research in US, 7 in 10 children living with mother are living poorly; this percentage is much higher than other types of families. Hence single-parent families are more likely to choose home cooking, rather than going to restaurant, to save the expenses. </p><h2 id="Factor-4-amp-5-Percentage-of-Bachelor-and-Graduate-Professional-Degree-Holder"><a href="#Factor-4-amp-5-Percentage-of-Bachelor-and-Graduate-Professional-Degree-Holder" class="headerlink" title="Factor 4 &amp; 5 - Percentage of Bachelor and Graduate/Professional Degree Holder"></a>Factor 4 &amp; 5 - Percentage of Bachelor and Graduate/Professional Degree Holder</h2><p>Bachelor degree describes the education level of a man and could explicitly reflect the work nature and consumption capacity. Well-educated people usually spend more time onto work or social activity and desire higher quality of life, which make them the potential customers of restaurants. However, people with even higher degree of Graduate / Professional tend to follow their daily routine and may not be willing to invest the time and energy to try new restaurants.</p><h2 id="Factor-6-amp-7-Divorced-and-Gay-Percentage"><a href="#Factor-6-amp-7-Divorced-and-Gay-Percentage" class="headerlink" title="Factor 6 &amp; 7 - Divorced and Gay Percentage"></a>Factor 6 &amp; 7 - Divorced and Gay Percentage</h2><p>Higher divorce percentage may indicate a higher percentage of people who like to make changes. They do not adhere to the old habits and likely not to stay at home to do home cooking. Instead they might dine out more and try new restaurants.<br>Higher gay percentage may indicate the higher percentage of People who are more open to break the tradition and accept new ideas. It also indicates the acceptance level of the public to new things in the region.<br>It might be a great idea to open a new restaurant in places whereby people are more likely to accept and make change and try something new.  </p><h2 id="Factor-8-Population-per-Sex-Offender"><a href="#Factor-8-Population-per-Sex-Offender" class="headerlink" title="Factor 8 Population per Sex Offender"></a>Factor 8 Population per Sex Offender</h2><p>Higher population per sex offender means lower number of sex offenders, which indicates better security and social morality.<br>Customers prefer to live and consume at a safe and secure place. Meanwhile, investors also prefer to do business at a safe area to keep their money secure. That could explain why the number of restaurants has negative correlation coefficient with the cases number of sex offender.</p><h1 id="Limitation-amp-Conclusion"><a href="#Limitation-amp-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Limitation &amp; Conclusion"></a>Limitation &amp; Conclusion</h1><ol><li>Inadequate amount of data<br>The restaurant data from Yelp is based on 3 states only, which has some impact on the result because it is not a full reflection of the whole USA restaurant business. </li><li>Lack of time-series data<br>The data is only a cross-sectional data (both Yelp and city-data), but not time-series. This brings difficulty in doing causal analysis and other further analysis.<br>Moreover, the restaurant data and the data from city-data.com may not be perfectly matching as there could be some differences in the date when the data was recorded. </li><li>Limitation of linear regression model<br>The adjusted R2 statistic pays a price for the inclusion of unnecessary variables in the model.</li><li>Other unquantifiable factors<br>The data used does not include several other unquantifiable factors, such as style of food, scale of a restaurant, etc. These factors would bring a big difference to the result analysis. For instance, a multi-vendor canteen may classified as only one restaurant, but it provides a large variety of food selection and options. It could be sufficient enough to have only one such multi-vendor canteen in a region.  </li><li>Inter-relationship with other restaurants<br>In this project, inter-relationship with other restaurants is too complicated and difficult to be considered in doing the statistical analysis. For example, restaurant with competitive relationship or complementary relationship. </li></ol><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>If you are going to open a new restaurant in USA. This project will provide some suggestions in selecting the location of your business. You are recommended to consider these eight factors provided in this project when choosing the location, instead of simply referring to local GPD per Capita or population. </p><h1 id="Demo-amp-Visualisation"><a href="#Demo-amp-Visualisation" class="headerlink" title="Demo &amp; Visualisation"></a>Demo &amp; Visualisation</h1><p>Data of Las Vegas, NV</p><div align="center"><br><div style="width:80%;margin-top:-20px;"><br><img src="/2016/03/24/biz-analytics/visual-1.png"><br><img src="/2016/03/24/biz-analytics/visual-2.png"><br><img src="/2016/03/24/biz-analytics/visual-3.png"><br><img src="/2016/03/24/biz-analytics/visual-4.png"><br><img src="/2016/03/24/biz-analytics/visual-5.png"><br><img src="/2016/03/24/biz-analytics/visual-6.png"><br></div></div><br>Data of Phoenix, AZ<br><br><div align="center"><br><div style="width:80%;margin-top:-20px;"><br><img src="/2016/03/24/biz-analytics/visual-7.png"><br><img src="/2016/03/24/biz-analytics/visual-8.png"><br><img src="/2016/03/24/biz-analytics/visual-9.png"><br><img src="/2016/03/24/biz-analytics/visual-10.png"><br><img src="/2016/03/24/biz-analytics/visual-11.png"><br><img src="/2016/03/24/biz-analytics/visual-12.png"><br></div></div><h1 id="Reference"><a href="#Reference" class="headerlink" title="Reference"></a>Reference</h1><p>[1] Kusisto, L., &amp; Hudson, K.

&lt;p&gt;The total number of restaurants in the USA is now over 616 thousands and keeps an increase of 7 percent per year. Restaurants, as a typical and important business tightly connected with people’s daily life, are often treated as an indicator of local economic scale and resident income, reflecting people’s quality of life in that region. However, there are no previous studies unveiling the real factors that influence the number of restaurants in a region during the last few decades when the total number of restaurants in the USA ever experienced the greatest growth. In this project, we collect data from the largest restaurant review website in the USA named “Yelp” and a demographic information website “City-Data”, make use of statistical models and thereby summarize the result obtained from statistical analysis tools.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div align="center" style="padding-bottom:15px;" width="100"><img src="/2014/05/20/chinese-segementation/cvr-chinese.png"></div><p>With the rapid development of social media, website like weibo has become a very important channel of getting information in Chinese speaking regions. In past few years, more and more people chose to use weibo to record what happened around them and express their experience and emotion in daily life due to its highly socialized and real-time features. Human society was greatly speeded up by Internet. And many new vocabularies or new informal writing were invented and widely used in the Internet. <a id="more"></a> Thanks to the natural language processing technical, the new vocabulary discovery could be done by computer programs rather than manually search. Some statistical concepts, such as Hidden Markov Model, provided a guideline to design the algorithm that could segment one sentence into a sequence of words with the maximum probability and best rationality. However, the realization of sentence segmentation would be varied for different languages. For instance, the words are naturally separately by spaces in Western languages but for most of East Asian languages such as Chinese, Japanese, Korean or Thai, on the contrary, the words are presented into characters and connected with each other without any separator. And that makes new words discovery in East Asian languages more difficult, challenging and flexible.<br>This project aimed to find an efficient way to discover new Chinese vocabularies invented from the Internet and used them into Chinese article segmentation, and consequently provided suggestion and methods to improve the current Chinese natural language processing technology. In this project, several concepts and techniques related to natural language processing and information extraction were adopted and several times of experiments were carried out to obtain the most desirable result.<br>The experimental results showed that the algorithms implemented for this project could find most of new vocabularies successfully and make some improvement onto the existing Chinese segmentation tools. The detailed result analysis showing how much improvement could be made and further discussion about the limitation and future development work were conducted and reflected in this report.</p><h1 id="Background"><a href="#Background" class="headerlink" title="Background "></a>Background </h1><h2 id="Internet-Slang"><a href="#Internet-Slang" class="headerlink" title="Internet Slang"></a>Internet Slang</h2><p>21st Century is the century of Internet. With the explosion in population of Internet users, a new kind of language, the Internet Slang, was introduced into people’s lives and became extremely popular during last few years.</p><p>As the language with most people used around the world, Chinese language also been exposed to the language revolution brought by Internet. More and more new vocabularies were invented on the Internet and adopted by people into real daily lives. Within these new vocabularies, some of them were simpler or shorter writing of the formal words (e.g. 女主 - heroine); some of them were invented to express new things or new phenomena in the society (e.g. 微博 - weibo, a Chinese social network like twitter), and what the most interesting is, some of the new words were informal or mistake writing to the existing words intentionally or unintentionally, but more popular than the original ones (e.g. 程序猿 – a homophony of programmer in Chinese).</p><div align="center"><br><div style="width:60%;margin-top:-20px;"><br><img src="/2014/05/20/chinese-segementation/1-new-words.png" title="New words"><br></div></div><h2 id="Natural-Language-Processing"><a href="#Natural-Language-Processing" class="headerlink" title="Natural Language Processing"></a>Natural Language Processing</h2><p>The natural language processing (shorted as NLP) became a hot topic in computer science field in last few years. With statistical knowledge and many cutting-edge information technologies like text extraction, machine learning and artificial intelligence involved in, the NLP enables machine to understand human’s natural languages and response with intelligence. These natural languages could not only be English but also Arabic, Germany or even Chinese.</p><h2 id="When-Natural-Language-Processing-Meets-Internet-Slang"><a href="#When-Natural-Language-Processing-Meets-Internet-Slang" class="headerlink" title="When Natural Language Processing Meets Internet Slang"></a>When Natural Language Processing Meets Internet Slang</h2><p>The mechanism that enables machine to understand human’s natural languages is completely realized by being given a dictionary with all vocabularies listed in it. And it works well in formal language such as documentations, reports or journals. But in past few years, the Internet slang started being used by people frequently and widely, the traditional natural language processing could not satisfy people’s need just by simply reading language and checking in the dictionary. Therefore, the latest natural language processing technics were expected to discovery new words in natural languages and add them into the dictionary automatically. In fact, the efficiency of the new words discovery nowadays has already became one of the most significant factors for determining the quality of a natural language processing tool.</p><h1 id="Objectives"><a href="#Objectives" class="headerlink" title="Objectives"></a>Objectives</h1><p>The natural language processing in English and other Western languages were well developed in last several decades. Today there are more than one mature products or toolkits for the NLP in English, for example, the well-known personal voice assistant application called “Siri”, or a famous free NLP development toolkit named “Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)”. However, unlike those language formed by Latin letters, some East Asian languages, such as Chinese, it is presented as consecutive characters rather than writing in letters and segmented by white spaces. In another word, before understanding and analysis the detailed meaning of Chinese language, the machine must be able to segment an entire coherent sentence constructed by a series of Chinese characters in right ways.</p><p>There are two main objectives of this project:</p><p>Firstly, this project was to learn the existing Chinese sentence segmentation tools and research on the working mechanism behind.</p><p>Then, the student was expected to come up with a solution than could make improvement onto one of them for usage onto the texts used in social networks like weibo, and then implement it. The final result will be measured by the precision/recall rate in both the new words discovery and the segmentation result on the given testing text, thereby provide a feasible and effective solution.</p><h1 id="Literature-Review"><a href="#Literature-Review" class="headerlink" title="Literature Review"></a>Literature Review</h1><h2 id="Natural-Language-Processing-and-Chinese-Language"><a href="#Natural-Language-Processing-and-Chinese-Language" class="headerlink" title="Natural Language Processing and Chinese Language"></a>Natural Language Processing and Chinese Language</h2><p>Natural language is defined as language that is used for human’s daily communication like English, Portuguese or Chinese, rather than the artificial languages designed for machine’s understanding such as mathematical notations or programming languages. However, the computer couldn’t parse and understand natural language directly. There must be a technical routine called Natural Language Processing, or NLP for short, guiding and operating machines to manipulate the natural language. The NLP is the set of all methodologies and operations related to natural language, it covers the tasks that simply counting the frequency of words in comparison of different writing styles, or extremely understand human’s voice command and response correctly [1].</p><p>The basic steps of the NLP in English or other kinds of language in Latin letters’ form contain text tokenization, categorizing and tagging words, syntactic analysis and further analysis and application. For instance, the tokenization in English is simply splitting sentences with white spaces and applying recognition filter for some special cases like Word-internal punctuation (e.g. some abbreviations such as “etc.”, “Vol.”, “Prof.”), clitics (e.g. “I’m”, “doesn’t”) and multi-token words (e.g. “New York”, “Ang Mo Kio”, “Johnson &amp; Johnson”) [2]. But the NLP in many East Asian languages such as Chinese has a little bit difference since the Chinese is written in consecutive Chinese characters and there is no natural boundaries separating each word, the text tokenization process could be much more complex when compared to the NLP in English [3]. That means the Chinese text must be processed by segmentation program for tokenization before further processing such as syntactic analysis.</p><h2 id="Language-Model-and-N-Gram"><a href="#Language-Model-and-N-Gram" class="headerlink" title="Language Model and N-Gram"></a>Language Model and N-Gram</h2><p>Suppose an incomplete sentence with one unknown word in specific position, the intuitive way to identify that missing word from plenty of candidates is choosing the one could achieve in highest likelihood probability as a sentence in its natural language. The Chain Rule enable us to compute probabilities of entire sequences like P(w1 , w2 , …, wn). The Chain Rule suggests that we could estimate the joint probability of an entire sequence of words by multiplying a number of conditional probabilities together. However, the human natural language is creative and we cannot ensure any words or sentences have occurred in the corpus. Therefore it seems impossible to estimate the joint probability by counting the number of occurring times in corpus of every word following every long string [4].</p><div align="center"><br><div style="width:60%;margin-top:-20px;"><br><img src="/2014/05/20/chinese-segementation/equation-1.png"><br></div></div><p>The N-gram model is designed to solve the predicament that the joint probability seems not able to be calculated efficiently. What N-gram represents is a slice with N-character in length among a longer string. The most widely used N-gram models are uni-gram, bi-gram and tri-gram. According to the Markov Assumption, the probability of a word occurring after a string only related to the joint probability of N words sequence previous to its position (a prefix of N). It could be expressed in the mathematical notations as that:</p><div align="center"><br><div style="width:60%;margin-top:-20px;"><br><img src="/2014/05/20/chinese-segementation/equation-2.png"><br></div></div><p>And thereby the joint probability of a whole sentence or paragraph could be calculated in much easier way as well. The formal is supposed like (Suppose N=2) [5]:</p><div align="center"><br><div style="width:60%;margin-top:-20px;"><br><img src="/2014/05/20/chinese-segementation/equation-3.png"><br></div></div><p>Since the usage of N-gram is a part of Markov Assumption, the joint probability of a sentence or a sequence of text is just an approximated value. Theoretically speaking, the higher N is would lead to higher precision of the over probability. However, some N-grams would return zero or almost zero in probability that makes the true candidate difficult to be recognized among others. Besides that, the higher N is means higher calculation workload exerted to the machine and less performance efficiency in the prediction, and the Chain Rule formal could be regarded as an extreme situation of N-gram estimation where N is equal to the length of the text sequence [6].</p><p>Moreover, in order to prevent the existing of zero probability that might invalidate calculation of the joint probability, a statistics technique named additive smoothing (also known as Laplace smoothing) was widely adopted by different NLP tools. That smoothing technique measures all probabilities by adding a smoothing parameter α to force all estimation on resulting probability fall in the range of its original empirical estimate (xi/N) and uniform probability (1/d) [7].</p><div align="center"><br><div style="width:60%;margin-top:-20px;"><br><img src="/2014/05/20/chinese-segementation/equation-4.png"><br></div></div><h2 id="Unsupervised-Chinese-Word-Segmentation"><a href="#Unsupervised-Chinese-Word-Segmentation" class="headerlink" title="Unsupervised Chinese Word Segmentation"></a>Unsupervised Chinese Word Segmentation</h2><p>The unsupervised Chinese word segmentation became a popular research topic and well developed in the past two decades. Nowadays there are many Chinese segmentation technologies and tools available and some of them could achieve as high as 99% precision rate [8]. But there are still some limitations in this field that make Chinese word segmentation imperfect, such as there is no clear definition of “word” itself in Chinese language – same pair or group of Chinese characters was recognized as a word by some people but may not be regarded as a word by some other people (e.g. “一只/det” or “一/num只/n” in “一只老虎” ); Besides that, the ambiguity (e.g. “才/ad 能/v” and “才能/n” when segmenting the sentence“只有这样才能成功”) and new words which are not recorded in dictionary also restrict the performance of Chinese word segmentation [8].</p><div align="center"><br><div style="width:60%;margin-top:-20px;"><br><img src="/2014/05/20/chinese-segementation/2-chinese-seg.png" title="An Example of Chinese Segmentation"><br></div></div><p>The existing unsupervised Chinese word segmentation could be classified into three classes in general.</p><p>(i) The first kind of segmentation is based on Maximum Matching method (short as MM method), the final output is the alternative with maximized tokenization result, in another word, is the alternative has maximum number of words be segmented. This method could be further divided into Forward Maximum Matching (FMM), Backward Maximum Matching (BMM) and combinatory of FMM and BMM (choose the optimal result from both FMM and BMM). The advantage of this method is simple, fast and fair quality of the output result [9].</p><p>However, this segmentation is not good enough for some cases that some sequences of Chinese characters wrongly recognized as words with high probability. E.g. “结婚的和尚未结婚的” will always be segmented as “结婚/的/和尚/未/结婚/的” rather than the correct one “结婚/的/和/尚未/结婚/的” because “和尚/n – monk” has more occurring frequency and higher probability than the word “尚未/ad – not yet” in some dictionaries, in another sentence, P(结婚)×P(的)×P(和)×P(尚未)×P(结婚)×P(的) &lt; P(结婚)×P(的)×P(和尚)×P(未)×P(结婚)×P(的).</p><p>(ii) There is another method named Statistical Language Models (SLM). The SLM segments Chinese text by considering the probability of specific combination of Chinese characters instead of just referring to the dictionary, and this model was also called N-gram, which is introduced in previous section. The N-gram is an important statistical language model and the most widely used is bi-gram. Most of well-known Chinese sentence segmentation tools are developed based on this bi-gram model, such as the free distribution of NLPIR 2013. In these models, the frequency of each word is determined by words ahead. The SLM method needs large enough corpus support and requires higher performance of the machine. The benefit of this method is high precision especially for higher level of N-gram model [9].</p><p>(iii) The last one method is also the latest one, is called Automatic Chinese Word Segmentation based on Artificial Intelligence. The keywords of this approach are Neural Networks algorithm and Expert System algorithm. By adoption of artificial intelligence theory, the segmentation program is able to learn and discover new words or potential combination of Chinese characters automatically after accepting enough training. This method could achieve highest precision ever but complex in logic and algorithm design. But under the rapid development of high performance computing and artificial intelligence, it will be the mainstream of Chinese segmentation research in the future [9].</p><h2 id="Active-Learning-for-NLP"><a href="#Active-Learning-for-NLP" class="headerlink" title="Active Learning for NLP "></a>Active Learning for NLP </h2><p>Machine Learning is a collection of artificial intelligence methods requires supervised data to learn a concept, and then provides the execution result with higher efficiency and accuracy. However, labelling data by hand-annotation is expensive, time consuming, tedious, mistake prone and hard to adapt for new purposes. Therefore, people has looked at a more compromise alternative that using semi-supervised and unsupervised learning techniques for the purpose of obtaining experimental result with high quality and with acceptable cost as well.</p><p>An active learning problem contains a classifier, a small set of labelled samples and a large set of unlabelled data. Firstly, the classifier is trained on the labelled samples under the supervision to learn the concept and form a rule to guide itself for further classifying. The active learning methods are widely used in two types of problems in natural language processing field, which are classification task like text classification, and structured prediction task such as parsing and name entity recognition. Based on Arora and Agarwal’s research, the application of active learning technique in protein names recognition could achieve the same F-score as unsupervised method with 39% less data samples [10].</p><p>In this project, the active learning technique was supposed to play a significant role in new word discovery with higher accuracy and efficiency.</p><h2 id="The-NLPIR"><a href="#The-NLPIR" class="headerlink" title="The NLPIR"></a>The NLPIR</h2><div align="center"><br><div style="width:35%;margin-top:-20px;"><br><img src="/2014/05/20/chinese-segementation/3-hhmm-chinese-lex.png"><br></div></div><p>The NLPIR is short writing of the Natural Language Processing &amp; Information Retrieval Sharing Platform developed by Big Data Search and Mining Lab at Beijing Institute of Technology. Its Chinese word segmentation function was formerly known as ICTCLAS (Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Lexical Analysis System), a powerful segmentation tools based on Hierarchical Hidden Markov model (HHMM) and it used to win the first place in SIGHAN competition in 2003. The latest stable version of NLPIR till the beginning of this project was NLPIR 2013 and the API package is freely distributed to the public.</p><p>The Hidden Markov Models (HMM) is a statistical Markov model belongs to the second class of segmentation method and it is widely used in for modelling stochastic processes and sequences in applications like text analysis or speech recognition [11]. To simplify, the HMM was probability notation in considering both transition probabilities and observation likelihoods. As one of HHMM-based Chinese lexical analysis tools, the NLPIR Chinese word segmentation work is done in five levels: atom segmentation, simple &amp; recursive unknown words recognition, class-based segmentation and POS tagging [12]. The first level HMM will be introduced with more details of the algorithm and mechanism of the NLPIR segmentation.</p><p>The formula to calculate the word segmentation is listed below:</p><div align="center"><br><div style="width:60%;margin-top:-20px;"><br><img src="/2014/05/20/chinese-segementation/equation-5.png"><br></div></div><p>Some examples and figures in later sub-sections are citied from an academic blog:<em><a href="http://blog.csdn.net/sinboy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://blog.csdn.net/sinboy</a></em></p><h2 id="Atom-Segmentation"><a href="#Atom-Segmentation" class="headerlink" title="Atom Segmentation"></a>Atom Segmentation</h2><p>The atom segmentation is the first step during the Chinese sentence segmentation. A sentence will be tokenized at the beginning, and then be segmented into the minimum un-dividable unit as single Chinese character. This unit to present the minimum unit is called atom. Each atom has three attributes: the atom word; the POS tag annotation (“nPOS”, 1 as beginning mark, 4 as ending mark, and all other atom are labelled 0 since there are just an atom unit rather than a word) and the atom length. After atom segmentation, a sentence is supposed to be made up with a sequence of atoms that being filled with single Chinese character or a sequence of the longest consecutive non-Chinese characters like punctuation, digit or English words [13].</p><p>The figure below shows an example how a simple Chinese sentence being segmented and stored during atom segmentation.</p><div align="center"><br><div style="width:60%;margin-top:-20px;"><br><img src="/2014/05/20/chinese-segementation/4-atom-seg.png" title="An Example Showing Atom Segmentation"><br></div></div><p>According to the official description of the NLPIR, it is the one of the Chinese word segmentation tools with the highest performance and best segmentation result even it is still not perfect. Moreover, the NLPIR provides an API to the public freely for non-commercial purpose. That is why the project will use NLPIR 2013 as the research object and do further improvement if possible.</p><h2 id="Rough-Segmentation"><a href="#Rough-Segmentation" class="headerlink" title="Rough Segmentation"></a>Rough Segmentation</h2><p>After obtaining a sequence of atom units, the first round rough segmentation will be conducted next. During this round of segmentation, all the possible segmentation alternatives for the given sentence will be listed out and there are two iterations to realize the algorithm. In the first iteration, each atom is being traversed and searching all the possible words formed by it and other atoms connected in the dictionary. This search could be done in the second iteration by traverse all the atoms after the base atom [14].</p><p> Suppose a sentence A0A1…AnAn+1…Am is given, the pseudo code algorithm to do the rough segmentation could be like:</p><figure class="highlight java"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">for</span>(<span class="keyword">int</span> i=<span class="number">0</span>; i&lt;m; i++)&#123;</span><br><span class="line">String s=A[i];</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">for</span>(<span class="keyword">int</span> j=i+<span class="number">1</span>; j&lt;m; j++)&#123;</span><br><span class="line">s=s+A[j];</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">if</span>(s is a word)&#123;</span><br><span class="line">add s into the list of the words;</span><br><span class="line">record the POS deteail;</span><br><span class="line">record the position and length of s;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>And a sentence “他说的确实在理” after this rough segmentation would become a words’ array chain with POS information, position and length saved into it.</p><div align="center"><br><div style="width:60%;margin-top:-20px;"><br><img src="/2014/05/20/chinese-segementation/5-example-rough-seg.png" title="An Example showing the Result of Rough Segmentation"><br></div></div><h2 id="N-Shortest-Path"><a href="#N-Shortest-Path" class="headerlink" title="N-Shortest Path"></a>N-Shortest Path</h2><p>After the rough segmentation, an array chain of all the possible words within the given sentence is acquired and next job is to form up one or more optimal paths linked all the candidate words from the beginning of the sentence to the end without any duplicate of single atom. The criteria of possibility of a specific words’ sequence, in another word the weight value, is determined by the weight of each atom and cohesion between each other. Here the idea of N-gram in HMM language model mentioned before is applied to calculate the weight value in this round of segmentation, the NLPIR call this algorithm N-Shortest Path [15]. The optimal path is the path with the minimum over weight by multiple all weights of candidate transitions together. The equation below is the simulation of the N-Shortest Path where N=2:</p><div align="center"><br><div style="width:60%;margin-top:-20px;"><br><img src="/2014/05/20/chinese-segementation/equation-6.png"><br></div></div><p>After calculating all the weight of candidate word pairs, the sentence in current stage could be expressed as a table drawn in the next page.</p><div align="center"><br><div style="width:90%;margin-top:-20px;"><br><img src="/2014/05/20/chinese-segementation/table-2.png" title="An example of N-Shortest Path in 2-D matrix"><br></div></div><div align="center"><br><div style="width:50%;margin-top:-20px;"><br><img src="/2014/05/20/chinese-segementation/6-n-short.png"><br></div></div><p>With the visual representation of the array chain of all the candidate words’ transition list above, the weight of each candidate path could be easily calculated and in NLPIR, the optimal path is obtained by executing Dijkstra algorithm for the case N=2. Back to the sample sentence, the shortest path could be obtained by applying the method stated before. The figure at right hand side shows the procedure of how the path acquired. The final path is “始##始@他@说@的@确实@在@理@末##末” with the minimum overall weight 68798.864.</p><p>After the first round of rough segmentation, the following several rounds of segmentation are focused on more specific cases such as geographic name entities, name entities and further optimization for final result. These following steps are realized by applying some additionally NLP related techniques. However, we won’t be discussed the details of other steps here because essentially they share the same idea in the segmentation. </p><h1 id="Experiment-Design"><a href="#Experiment-Design" class="headerlink" title="Experiment Design"></a>Experiment Design</h1><p>This Project Chapter introduces the details of this project which is implemented on the basis of NLPIR 2013 and could be separated into three main parts, the resources or materials to be used in this project; the logic and algorithm to realize the goal and the related documentation for this project.</p><h2 id="Hardware-Resources"><a href="#Hardware-Resources" class="headerlink" title="Hardware Resources"></a>Hardware Resources</h2><p>In consideration of this project needs lot of file I/O and text searching works, this project was implemented and tested on two computers with difference hardware configurations simultaneously to ensure the compatibility and performance of the project. </p><p><em>Main Implementation &amp; Testing Environment:</em></p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Configuration</strong></th><th><strong>Details</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Machine Model</td><td>Apple® MacBook Pro 15 (late 2011)</td></tr><tr><td>Operating System</td><td>Mac OS X Mavericks *(10.9.1 Build 13B42)</td></tr><tr><td>Processor</td><td>Intel® Core™ i7-2720QM Processor, 2.2GHz (up to 3.30 GHz)</td></tr><tr><td>Storage</td><td>250GB SSD</td></tr><tr><td>Memory</td><td>8GB DDR3</td></tr><tr><td>Software</td><td>eclipse (Standard 4.3.1 for Mac OS X)</td></tr><tr><td>Java Version</td><td>Java™ 7 pre-installed in Mac OS X</td></tr></tbody></table><p><em>Alternative Testing Environment:</em></p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Configuration</strong></th><th><strong>Details</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Machine Model</td><td>Lenovo® ThinkPad X61t (late 2007)</td></tr><tr><td>Operating System</td><td>Microsoft® Windows 7 Ultimate (Version 6.1, Build 7600)</td></tr><tr><td>Processor</td><td>Intel® Core™ 2 Duo L7500 Processor, 1.60GHz</td></tr><tr><td>Memory</td><td>2GB DDR2</td></tr><tr><td>Storage</td><td>500GB HDD, 7200 rpm</td></tr><tr><td>Software</td><td>eclipse (Kepler Release, Build id 20130614-0229)</td></tr><tr><td>Java Version</td><td>Java™ Standard Edition (Version 7 Update 45 build 1.7.0_45-b18)</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="Software-and-Project"><a href="#Software-and-Project" class="headerlink" title="Software and Project"></a>Software and Project</h2><p>The Software used in this project were two integrated development environment (IDE) software.

The objective of selecting formal data in testing this project, which is Chinese segmentation in informal content, was to ensure the performance of algorithms implemented in this project could still maintain a high level in segmenting formal text, and improve the efficiency in informal text segmentation simultaneously. Here the Annual Government Report of China in 2014, which could be the most formal Chinese language in the world, was selected in this category.</p><h1 id="Methodology"><a href="#Methodology" class="headerlink" title="Methodology "></a>Methodology </h1><p>To realize the goal of this project, which is more accurate Chinese segmentation in user generated content such as weibo, the student has to come up with a method to make the segmentation tool recognized as much words in given sentences as possible. The essential of the solution to this problem is the new words discovery and recognition.</p><p>The “new words” is a broad concept that includes latest vocabulary invented and other un-recognized words like short writing, informal writing with homophone or homograph. Most of these new words are invented and spread widely in the informal language on the Internet, for example in some forum, or social networks like weibo.</p><p>There is very common scenario that the sentences chosen from news article could be segmented by existing Chinese segmentation tool very well and sometimes the precision of the segmentation could reach almost 100%. But when these segmentation tools being tested by some posts extracted from weibo, the result is unsatisfying. This is because the dictionary is always limited and incomplete when facing to the user generated content on the Internet even it updates frequently. To make sure the “new words” in user generated content could be recognized automatically, a new words discovery program is needed to be implemented based on the existing Chinese segmentation tool, analysing and processing segmentation result from those segmentation tool, then telling the new words to the user.</p><p>Here is a sample sentence showing the difference between segmentation result output by NLPIR 2013 and the expected segmentation result after processing by this project.</p><div align="center"><br><div style="width:55%;margin-top:-20px;"><br><img src="/2014/05/20/chinese-segementation/7-nlpir-seg.png"><br></div></div><h2 id="New-Words-Extraction-from-NLPIR-Segmentation-Result"><a href="#New-Words-Extraction-from-NLPIR-Segmentation-Result" class="headerlink" title="New Words Extraction from NLPIR Segmentation Result"></a>New Words Extraction from NLPIR Segmentation Result</h2><p>To find the hidden “new word” from the NLPIR segmentation result, a definition about what kind of word can be assumed as “new word” should be given before the algorithm design phrase. After reading and analysing plenty of the segmentation output, the student predicated that the invention of new words could be tracked by the increasing usage and frequency occurred on the Internet in a specific period. For example, after the case of a two-year-old baby’s death after a motorist throwing on the ground, a special word “摔婴”, which literally means “throwing baby”, emerged on the Internet and widely known among Internet user.</p><p>Therefore an experiment was carried out to test whether new words could be found by observing its frequency, in another word, whether we can differentiate “new words” or non-word atom sequence according to their occurring frequency.</p><p>Assumption: all new words are constructed by <em>two</em> atoms.</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Randomly choose five consecutive text files contains weibo posts.</p><p>(e.g. 10.txt, 11.txt, 12.txt, 13.txt, 14.txt five files were chosen)</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Find all two-atom-combinations which occurred in all these five files</p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Count their occurrence in all 5 files and analysis the relevance between the tendency of occurrence frequency and its possibility of being a “new word”.</p><p>w1, w2, w3, w4, w5 are the list of atoms<br>    segmented from file1, file2, file3, file4 and file5</p><figure class="highlight java"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">for</span> (i = <span class="number">0</span>; i &lt; w1.length – <span class="number">1</span>; i++) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">word = w1[i]+w1[i+<span class="number">1</span>]</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">if</span> (w2.contains(word) &amp;&amp; w3.contains(word) </span><br><span class="line">&amp;&amp; w4.contains(word) &amp;&amp; w5.contains(word)) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">print i and its occurrence frequency in all <span class="number">5</span> files</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>Here is the figure showing the count of the occurrence in all 5 files for some of candidate “new words”:</p><div align="center"><br><div style="width:85%;margin-top:-20px;"><br><img src="/2014/05/20/chinese-segementation/8-occurrence-freq.png"><br></div></div><p>It is not difficult to see the distribution of the occurrence frequency of some chosen candidate new words in consecutive five files. If these 10 candidate new words were separated into two groups: one group contains those candidates used to have great fluctuation on the figure, the other group contains all the other candidates:</p><p>Table 4 an Example of the<br>candidates found from 5 consecutive files</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Group</strong></th><th><strong>Candidate</strong></th><th><strong>f1</strong></th><th><strong>f2</strong></th><th><strong>f3</strong></th><th><strong>f4</strong></th><th><strong>f5</strong></th><th><strong>True Vocabulary</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>A</strong></td><td><strong>短/a-信/n</strong></td><td>6</td><td>10</td><td>22</td><td>4</td><td>11</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><strong>吐/v-槽/ng</strong></td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>4</td><td>8</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><strong>更/d-好/a</strong></td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>16</td><td>2</td><td>Semi</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><strong>推/v-送/v</strong></td><td>4</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>14</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><strong>截/v-图/n</strong></td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>9</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><strong>一/m-天/qt</strong></td><td>4</td><td>7</td><td>17</td><td>9</td><td>12</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td><strong>B</strong></td><td><strong>是/vshi-吧/y</strong></td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><strong>妹/n-纸/n</strong></td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>5</td><td>Yes</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><strong>去/vf-的/ude1</strong></td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td></td><td><strong>一/m-种/q</strong></td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>No</td></tr></tbody></table><p>If we were looking for new words from these two groups, we can find that the accuracy in group A, those candidates has obvious fluctuation, is 66.67% or 83.33% if we count “更好” as one word; whereas, the group B could only 25.00%, lower to the group A obviously. And the most important thing is, when more candidates were compared, or larger size of data was involved into this experiment, the outcome is stronger to prove that those candidates with greater fluctuations in frequency have higher probabilities to be a true vocabulary, or a “true new word”.</p><p>The explanation from the student for this phenomenon is that for the invention of every true new word, it must experience a process that being used by more and more user, or occurring on the Internet more and more frequently. And this process became the great slope leading to higher value in the graph during some periods in history. That means, the fluctuation in the graph is the necessary condition of the behaviour of a legal new word.</p><p>This experiment provided a guideline to find the candidate of new words. Therefore all the candidate words in the project were extracted from mass weibo text by this method. Since according to relevant study in Chinese language, 99% Chinese vocabulary has a length less than five characters – that means the new word discovery only considering those candidates with length between 2 to 4 characters is fair enough.</p><p>here is only one possibility to find a candidate new word in length of 2 characters, which is the candidate formed by 2 consecutive atoms with length of 1 Chinese character. For those candidates in length of 3 and 4, there are multiple possibilities of the form of those candidates and the new word discovery need to consider all of these possibilities in theory. </p><p><span id="_Toc383415740" class="anchor"></span>Table 5 The Possible<br>Combination of New Words in Different Length</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Length</strong></th><th><strong>Form</strong></th><th><strong>Example （Chinese Char）</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>2</td><td>A+B</td><td>微+博</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>A+B+C, AA+B, A+BB</td><td>喵+星+人，东北+银</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>A+B+C+D, A+BB+C, A+B+CC, A+BBB, AA+B+C, AA+BB, AAA+B</td><td>喜+大+普+奔，累+觉+不+爱，顶+礼+膜拜</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Not all the combination of atoms in the forms listed in the table above could be assumed as candidates.

Once there is evidence showing one sequence of atoms that not only following the construction listed in the table above, but also occurred in a number of consecutive files with increasing in frequency (the up slope in the graph), this sequence of atoms is a candidate new word.<br>The pseudo-code of this process could be expressed as:</p><p>Assumption:<br>number of consecutive files = 3,<br>only the sequence of atoms has count of occurrence shows 2x increasing when compared to the previous file is considered: the multiplier k = 2,<br>All new words has length of 2.</p><p>given w1, w2 and w3 as the list of atoms from file1, file2 and file3<br>given k = 2</p><figure class="highlight java"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">for</span> (i = <span class="number">0</span>; i &lt; w1.length – <span class="number">1</span>; i++) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">word = w1[i]+w1[i+<span class="number">1</span>]</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">if</span> (w2.contains(word) &amp;&amp; w3.contains(word)) &#123;</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">if</span>(count(word, w2)&gt;=k*count(word, w1) </span><br><span class="line">&amp;&amp; count(word, w3)&gt;=k*count(word, w2)) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">add word into the candidateNewWord list</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><h2 id="Qualification-of-New-Words-from-Candidates"><a href="#Qualification-of-New-Words-from-Candidates" class="headerlink" title="Qualification of New Words from Candidates"></a>Qualification of New Words from Candidates</h2><p>In this subsection, four different methods/algorithms are introduced to pick up and certify the candidates we got from last step. Each of these four methods/algorithms will be introduced in detail and the analysis on the outcome will be expressed into the data and charts obtained from the experiment.</p><h3 id="1-Unsupervised-Unconditional-New-Word-Discovery"><a href="#1-Unsupervised-Unconditional-New-Word-Discovery" class="headerlink" title="(1) Unsupervised Unconditional New Word Discovery"></a>(1) Unsupervised Unconditional New Word Discovery</h3><p>As the name of this method suggests, this method doesn’t do any selection or screening work onto the candidate new words. Every candidate new words extracted from the given numbers of weibo text will be added into the user customized dictionary and used into further segmentation. This method seems feasible especially when both the number of consecutive files and the multiplier k are set to big enough in value. However, the actual experiment result denied this hypothesis.</p><p>Firstly, an experience was conducted to find the n and k, which are the number of the files in each new word discovery and the multiplier of frequency to identify the new word in n consecutive files. The controlling variables method was applied in this experiment on both n and k to provide a suggestion in choosing the optimum value of these two variables in following part of project.</p><div align="center"><br><div style="width:55%;margin-top:-20px;"><br><img src="/2014/05/20/chinese-segementation/9-num-candidate.png" title="The Number of Candidate with Different Combination of k and n"><br></div></div><p>In figure 9, we found the number of candidate new words was varied with different multiplier of frequency in n consecutive files. And the number of candidate new word when n=3 is the best instance which reflected the continuity of the process of new words’ invention, and at the same time kept the number of candidate new words founds in range from 1 to 150 with different <em>k</em> value, those are some values neither too big to do the manually statistics nor too small to satisfy the fairness of the final conclusion in this project.</p><div align="center"><br><div style="width:55%;margin-top:-20px;"><br><img src="/2014/05/20/chinese-segementation/10-num-candidate.png" title="The Number of Candidate New Words with Different Value k when n=3"><br></div></div><p>After the confirmation of assigning 3 to the variable n, now let’s focus on the proper k value to use in following experiments. There are curves of 8 combinations of 3 consecutive files filled with weibo posts in timely order on the plot. It is not difficult to find that when there are too many candidate new words found when given k=1, however, when k is assigned to some other value greater than 2, the number of candidate new words seems too small because of too strict condition. For example, k=3 means a combination of segmented atoms could be assumed as a candidate new word only its occurrence frequency triples each time. In consideration of both reasonability and proper number of candidate new word found, k=2 is chosen in the end.</p><p>The unsupervised unconditional new word discovery was implemented after the confirmation of assignment of all key variables. The term “unsupervised” means no more interference from user will be imposed on the new word discovery, the project was executed totally by itself And the term “unconditional” means all the candidate new words was supposed to be true new word, or new invented vocabulary without being filtered with any condition.</p><p>The pseudo code of unsupervised unconditional new words discovery was given below:</p><figure class="highlight java"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br><span class="line">17</span><br><span class="line">18</span><br><span class="line">19</span><br><span class="line">20</span><br><span class="line">21</span><br><span class="line">22</span><br><span class="line">23</span><br><span class="line">24</span><br><span class="line">25</span><br><span class="line">26</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">k = <span class="number">1</span>;</span><br><span class="line">ArrayList&lt;String&gt; newWordList = extractNewWordsFrom3Files(</span><br><span class="line">candidateNewWords(s1),</span><br><span class="line">candidateNewWords(s2),</span><br><span class="line">candidateNewWords(s3));</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="function">function <span class="title">candidateNewWords</span><span class="params">(String s)</span>:</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="function">String[] atoms </span>= s.split(“ ”);</span><br><span class="line">ArrayList&lt;String&gt; candidates = <span class="keyword">new</span> ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">for</span>(<span class="keyword">int</span> count = <span class="number">0</span>; count&lt;atoms.length-<span class="number">1</span>; count++)&#123;</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">if</span>((atoms[count].length()==<span class="number">1</span>) &amp;&amp; (atoms[count+<span class="number">1</span>].length()==<span class="number">1</span>))</span><br><span class="line">candidates.add(atoms[count]+     atoms[count+<span class="number">1</span>]);</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">return</span> candidates;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="function">function <span class="title">extractNewWordsFrom3Files</span> <span class="params">(</span></span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="params">ArrayList&lt;String&gt; al1, ArrayList&lt;String&gt; al2, ArrayList&lt;String&gt; al3)</span></span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="function">ArrayList&lt;String&gt; newWords </span>= <span class="keyword">new</span> ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();</span><br><span class="line">String candidate = “”;</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">for</span>(<span class="keyword">int</span> i = <span class="number">0</span>; i&lt;atoms.length-<span class="number">1</span>; i++)&#123;</span><br><span class="line">candidate = al1.get(i);</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">if</span>((al2.contains(candidate) &amp;&amp; (al2.contains(candidate)) &amp;&amp;</span><br><span class="line">(al2.count(candidate)/al1.count(candidate)&gt;=k) &amp;&amp; (al2.count(candidate)/al1.count(candidate)&gt;=k))</span><br><span class="line">newWords.add(al1.get(i));</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">return</span> newWords;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><blockquote><p>Input:<br>s1: “过去 一 年 ， 我 每 天 都 会 使用 微 博 。”<br>s2: “微 博 现在 非常 流行 ， 我 每 天 都 用 微 博 ， 我 很 喜欢 。”<br>s3: “我 每 天 都 去 学校 ，我 常常 在 路 上 刷 微 博 ， 发 微 博 。”</p></blockquote><p>Output (only the words typed in underline bold style are true new words):<br>newWordList: “，我” “我每” “每天” “天都” “微博”</p><p>As results showed above, this unsupervised unconditional could found all potential new vocabulary from Internet in theory, but the problem it brought to us was there were too many useless candidate new words like the combination of atoms containing punctuations also found and mixed with those real new words, which imposed too much workload to choose real new words from the result manually. Obviously, this is not a good solution to discover new words.</p><h3 id="2-Unsupervised-Conditional-New-Words-Discovery"><a href="#2-Unsupervised-Conditional-New-Words-Discovery" class="headerlink" title="(2) Unsupervised Conditional New Words Discovery"></a>(2) Unsupervised Conditional New Words Discovery</h3><p>Since the result of new words discovery was not satisfying in unsupervised unconditional method, some improvement was urgent to be made to realize the goal of this project, which is a more efficient way to find the new words in user generated content.</p><p>By observing the result of the first method carefully, it was easy to find there are some of these candidate new words are obviously impossible to be one vocabulary or a new word. In another way, we could make a hypothesis that there is a rule to judge whether a combination of segmented atoms is a new words or not. And this rule was based on the POS tags of each segmented atoms, which is the properties of those atoms in the usage of Chinese.</p><p>After analysing the result from last method, some specific combinations of segmented atoms could be determined that they were mostly impossible to be qualified as a new word, especially a word made up with 2 characters. They included:<br>(a) Candidates new words contains punctuation(s) e.g. “，我”</p><p>(b) Candidates new words contains digits(s) e.g. “1个”</p><p>Besides that, based on the statistical work conducted for the known new words and analysis on Chinese words’ morphology, a rule can be summarized that most of new words were invented to describe a new phenomenon or new action. That means most of the new words created on Internet were nouns, adjectives or verbs. For those kinds of words made up with two Chinese characters, their combinations of POS tags mainly belong to one of those listed below:</p><p><span id="_Toc383415741" class="anchor"></span>Table 6 Some Common Combination of New Word</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Adjective/Noun</strong></th><th><strong>Verb</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Noun + Noun, e.g. 砖家/n</td><td>Verb + Verb, e.g. 签售/v</td></tr><tr><td>Adjective + Adjective, e.g. 高大/a</td><td>Verb + Adverb, e.g. 走起/v</td></tr><tr><td>Adjective + Noun, e.g. 微信/n</td><td>Verb + Noun, e.g. 翻墙/v</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>Adverb + Verb, e.g. 猛戳/v</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Therefore, two filters were implemented onto the code of the first method to improve the precision of the new words discovery. The first filter (filter A) was designed to filter out all combinations of atoms containing punctuations and digits before adding them into the list of candidate new words. Then the second filter (filter B) restricted the condition to determine whether a candidate new word is new word or not. In this filter, only the candidates satisfying the seven combinations of POS tags listed above would be considered and added into the new words’ list in the end.</p><p>The reason of implementing 2 filters rather than using the 2nd one only was the POS tags in NLPIR were varies in different sentence or different words. But the POS tagging operation still has some rules to track with:</p><p>All the POS tags of punctuation symbols are starting with a “w”. For example the period in Chinese, “。”, is “wd” and the comma “，” is “wj”.</p><p>All verbs’ tags must have a letter “v”, all adverbs’ tags must have “d” , all noun/pronouns’ tags must have a letter “n” and all adjectives must have “a” in their tags.</p><p>To prevent the period was recognized as an adverb, double filter method was applied to provide a safe way to proceed with the conditional new words discovery. This implementation was summarized as unsupervised conditional new words discovery, it removed out all two consecutive atoms contains punctuation and digits before picking up those belong to specific POS tags combination.</p><div align="center"><br><div style="width:70%;margin-top:-20px;"><br><img src="/2014/05/20/chinese-segementation/11-procedures.png" title="The Procedures of Unsupervised Conditional Algorithm"><br></div></div><p>The figure above showed the procedures and specific result of the unsupervised conditional new words discovery. It proved that the unsupervised conditional new words discovery could greatly decrease the number of qualified new words in the end. But the usage of filter was not perfect, sometimes even the true new words could not be qualified by the filter because of too strict and limited fileting condition in POS tags to recognize all new words. For instance, the atom combination “给/prep” and “力/noun” (给力/adj - awesome), and some un-recognized words marked as “nr” like the atom combination “尼/b” and “玛/nr” (尼玛/int - interjection), they are true new words and widely used on Internet but failed to be found in current new word discovery algorithm because their POS tags are too rare to be added into the filter.</p><h3 id="3-Active-Learning-New-Words-Discovery"><a href="#3-Active-Learning-New-Words-Discovery" class="headerlink" title="(3) Active-Learning New Words Discovery"></a>(3) Active-Learning New Words Discovery</h3><p>We can image that most of regular new words could be found by unsupervised new words discovery when as complete as possible conditions are given. But for some new words composed by the character with rare or even un-recognized POS tags, they seem impossible to pass the filter and then founded by unsupervised new word discovery. Now we need to move back to the essential feature of our definition of “new words”. Before designing the algorithm, several experiments was carried out to find proper value of the variable n and k, and then we made an assumption in this project that any consecutive characters had k times exponential growth in frequency among minimum n consecutive time period could be defined as a new word invented on Internet. That means all candidate new words generated actually hold same possibility to be a valid new word, or a true vocabulary. Therefore, an active-learning algorithm was designed to release the power that determines whether a candidate is a truly new word or not to the user, and the program only focused on learning from user’s input and summarizing them into a collection of rules to use into further new words discovery.</p><p>Firstly, instead of only recording the details of two consecutive atoms, the active learning new word discovery saved both two atoms themselves and two adjacent atoms. And each time a pair of atoms and their POS tags showed up, the user could also check the POS tag of their previous atom and their next atom. These previous tag and next tag was called transition record upon a candidate new word.</p><div align="center"><br><div style="width:60%;margin-top:-20px;"><br><img src="/2014/05/20/chinese-segementation/12-difference.png" title="Difference between Unsupervised & Active-Learning Algorithm in New Words Discovery"><br></div></div><p>Besides that, not only those candidate new words that satisfying k times exponential increasing in frequency would be saved, another list of atoms’ pair was set up to save those candidates failed to satisfying k times exponential rule but existing in consecutive n time periods. The first list with regular candidate new words was renamed to candidates with higher frequency, or “HF”, at this time, and the second list was named candidates with lower frequency, shortly recorded as “LF”.</p><p>During the execution, the program would keep querying those candidate new words from “HF”. The content of query included whether it was a word or not and the POS tag of this new word if yes. Once user gave positive response and provided the POS tag, the program would search all others candidates from “HF” and added those candidate new words, who shared same POS tags for both transition record and two atoms’ themselves, together with the candidate queried to the user, into the qualified new words list. Because the candidates who shared same transition states and POS tags with a known true new word, were believed to be true new words also. And each time user response to query to a candidate new word, this candidate new word and all candidates automatically qualified and added into the new words list would be removed from the list “HF”, those to maintain the number of query within a lower level.</p><p>This algorithm is an active-learning process to concede the authority to the user and machines itself would focus on the learning and further automation.

The first one it to measure how good the new words discovery algorithms designed in this project could find the new words; the other one is how good the segmentation program could behaviour with new words found in this project added into the dictionary. The results of these two measurements could directly reflect the project was successful or not, and provide the proof to the evaluation of this project.</p><h2 id="Measurement-for-New-Words-Discovery"><a href="#Measurement-for-New-Words-Discovery" class="headerlink" title="Measurement for New Words Discovery "></a>Measurement for New Words Discovery </h2><p>The evaluation of new words discovery algorithms could be done by calculating their efficiency in finding the truly new words. For example, if there was a new word discovery algorithm A finding 100 new words but only 10 of them were true and valid new words (with efficiency 10%), and algorithm B finding only 10 new words but 8 of these 10 words were true and valid (with efficiency 80%), we cannot assert that the algorithm A had better performance than B because algorithm A contains more useless “words” and thus probably resulted in higher noises in the actual segmentation. </p><p>The procedure of the result statistics could be summarized as:</p><p>(1) Choose test data from different categories: Formal Article, Semi-formal Article and weibo Post (Informal User Generated Content), to test how much improvement could be made on different usage of Chinese segmentation.</p><p>(2) Run the four new words discovery algorithms separately and saved the new words found into different place.</p><p>(3) Manually Count the number of true words from the new word discovery result generated by each algorithm.</p><p>(4) Calculate the efficiency by dividing the number of true new words over the total number of words found for each of four algorithms.</p><h2 id="Measurement-for-Chinese-Segmentation"><a href="#Measurement-for-Chinese-Segmentation" class="headerlink" title="Measurement for Chinese Segmentation"></a>Measurement for Chinese Segmentation</h2><p>As what had mentioned in the Literature Review, the results of Chinese segmentation in this project were measured in terms of Precision, Recall and F-1 score.</p><div align="center"><br><div style="width:80%;margin-top:-20px;"><br><img src="/2014/05/20/chinese-segementation/15-test-matrix.png" title="A 2×2 Contingency Table Showing 4 Outcomes in Classification Tasks"><br></div></div><p>The procedure of the result statistics could be summarized as:</p><p>(1) Run the four new words discovery algorithms separately and saved the new words found into different place.</p><p>(2) Choose test data from different categories: Formal Article, Semi-formal Article and weibo Post (Informal User Generated Content), to test how much improvement could be made on different usage of Chinese segmentation.</p><p>(3) Run the NLPIR 2013 program with original dictionary and with new words generated by four algorithms added into the customized dictionary one by one, save the segmentation result for further analysis.</p><p>(4) Manually Segment these test data, Record the result as the condition outcome, or the “Gold Standard” mentioned in figure 16.</p><p>(5) Manually Count the number of words correctly segmented, mark as “True Positive”; the number of words wrongly segmented, mark as “False Positive”; and the number of atoms failed to be segmented as a word, mark as “False Negative”.</p><pre><code>E.g.

These four algorithms were Unsupervised Unconditional New Words Discovery (shorted as UU), Unsupervised Conditional New Words Discovery (shorted as UC), Active-Learning New Words Discovery Type A (shorted as Active Type A) and Active-Learning New Words Discovery Type B (shorted as Active Type B).</p><p>As for some new words found from these algorithms such as “一个”, “读书”, “小狗”, “不错”, “较好”, “最大”, which could be recognized as either a vocabulary entity or a combination of two words. In NLPIR 2013, this kind of atoms’ combinations would not be recognized as single words according to NLPIR dictionary standard. However, segmenting this kind of atoms’ combinations as distinct “words” will not leave any negative influence to the existing segmentation tool but it improved the efficiency of new words discovery algorithms a lot since these words totally satisfy the rule of a “new word” in the algorithms implemented in this project. Therefore, this kind of words were marked as “reasonable words” and the efficiency of new words discovery was calculated twice, the first one strictly followed the NLPIR standard without counting reasonable words in; and the other version of efficiency considered those reasonable words as valid new words. </p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>What this Project Recognized</strong></th><th><strong>What NLPIR Recognized</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>一个/q</td><td>一/m 个/q</td></tr><tr><td>读书/v</td><td>读/v 书/n</td></tr><tr><td>小狗/n</td><td>小/ad 狗/n</td></tr><tr><td>不错/ad</td><td>不/no 错/ad</td></tr><tr><td>较好/ad_comp</td><td>较/d 好/ad</td></tr><tr><td>最大/ad_sup</td><td>最/d 大/ad</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Table 7 Samples of Reasonable Words</p><table><thead><tr><th></th><th><strong>New Words Found</strong></th><th><strong>Valid New Words</strong></th><th><strong>Efficiency</strong></th><th><strong>Reasonable Words Found</strong></th><th><strong>Efficiency (with Reasonable Words Counted In)</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>UU</td><td>3945</td><td>189</td><td>4.7909%</td><td>114</td><td>7.6806%</td></tr><tr><td>UC</td><td>920</td><td>161</td><td>17.5000%</td><td>97</td><td>28.0435%</td></tr><tr><td>Active Type A</td><td>487</td><td>173</td><td>35.5236%</td><td>51</td><td>45.9959%</td></tr><tr><td>Active Type B</td><td>698</td><td>224</td><td>32.0917%</td><td>130</td><td>50.7163%</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Table Efficiency of New Words Discovery</p><p>From the result, it is easy to conclude that the Active-Learning algorithm Type B is the best in both the total number of valid new words found and efficiency. On the contrary, the efficiency of Unsupervised Unconditional new words discovery algorithm (UU) is only 7.6806% even counting in all reasonable words. That means each time a hundred “new words” found by UU algorithm, there are more than 92 of them are not truly new words and these fake new words might severely affect the segmentation outcome in the end.</p><h2 id="Evaluation-on-Chinese-Sentence-Segmentation"><a href="#Evaluation-on-Chinese-Sentence-Segmentation" class="headerlink" title="Evaluation on Chinese Sentence Segmentation"></a>Evaluation on Chinese Sentence Segmentation</h2><p>In this section, all 4 algorithms were tested by adding the new words found into the dictionary and then analysing the segmentation results on 3 text file. The result was represented in the form of Precision, Recall and F1-Score. </p><div align="center"><br><div style="width:65%;margin-top:-20px;"><br><img src="/2014/05/20/chinese-segementation/table-9.png" title="Comparison of Precision, Recall and F-1 Score between Original NLPIR (The Maximum Value was Underlined)"><br></div></div><p>By observing the data shown in the Table 8, it is not difficult to find that the Unsupervised Unconditional New Words Discovery algorithm could always lead a higher precision, and all the new words discovery algorithms seem lead to worse recall when compared to the original NLPIR output. These phoneme could be explained that all these four algorithms had more or less added some useless words into the dictionary during the new word discovery. More valid new words found means potentially higher precision of the segmentation, but more useless new words found would bring more noise into the segmentation and make lots of sentences, which should have been successfully segmented, wrongly segmented in the end.</p><p>Therefore, a good solution should not only focus on either precision or recall, but the comprehensive result concerning both these two. A measurement called F-1 Score was adopted here to show us which alternative could lead to a better behaviour accounting for both precision and recall.</p><p>And in order to represent the F-1 score in easier way to understand, a chart was drawn to show the testing result in visual way.</p><div align="center"><br><div style="width:70%;margin-top:-20px;"><br><img src="/2014/05/20/chinese-segementation/16-f1-scores.png" title="Comparison of F-1 Scores among Different Segmentation Algorithms"><br></div></div><p>After calculating the F-1 scores, we could find that only the Active-Learning New Words Discovery algorithms could make improvement on segmentation of informal Chinese language only. That was because the F-1 score was affected by both precision and recall, that means any improvement made on either one but led another parameter in very low level couldn’t be reflected on the F-1 score, on the contrary, the F-1 score might be lower than the original result without any improvement implemented. Besides that, the existing Chinese segmentation tools such as NLPIR 2013 were good enough. This product itself was believed as a best adjustment on precision and recall to realize the maximum F-1 score, and that made any improvement designed for it could be very difficult.</p><p>Even though the significant improvement made on segmentation was extremely hard, the Active-Learning algorithm Type A stilled made over 0.16% enhancement when segmenting Chinese text in informal category, in another word, on user generate content like weibo posts.</p><p>You may ask why the performance of the algorithms implemented by student not enhanced in linear against the formalization of the testing data. The possible explanation might be that the semi-formal data was mostly formed by words in dictionary, but unlike the formal text, there were still some contents made up with new words. And when these algorithms implemented by the student did the regular new words discovery and applied new words into the segmentation, relatively too many useless new words created great noise in segmenting the sentence and that led the original segmentation routine not able to work correctly. Nevertheless, in the testing of formal Chinese language category, all algorithms didn’t affect the original segmentation too much because there were seldom opportunities containing a new words in a very formal article. This made the all these four algorithms resulted in very similar F-1 score in the end.</p><h1 id="Limitations"><a href="#Limitations" class="headerlink" title="Limitations"></a>Limitations</h1><p>Some limitations was found during this project and considered could vary the evaluation result from the ideal outcome:</p><p>(1) The dataset used in this project was limited. This project needed larger dataset that unlimitedly close to the universe data to obtain the good enough simulative result. Even 1.2 GB was a very big data sample; it still seems not enough for this project if further improvement or research would be carried out.</p><p>(2) The new words discovery algorithms highly relied on the real-time feature of the dataset. But the dataset used in this project was extracted based on specific group of users, rather than extracted from the real-time weibo posts. That would affect the trueness and reliability of the simulation.</p><p>(3) The difference between Chinese and Western language and the ambiguity of Chinese grammar restricted the development of existing Chinese segmentation because nearly all related theory and hypotheses were built based on English. For example, the comparative adjectives and superlative adjectives, these were recognized as distinct words in English but may not in Chinese like “较好”, “最大”. The confusion on the ambiguity, or the lack of a standard, would greatly vary the evaluation result of segmentation.</p><h1 id="Future-Recommendations"><a href="#Future-Recommendations" class="headerlink" title="Future Recommendations"></a>Future Recommendations</h1><p>If this project would be further carried out for some improvement or<br>referenced by other research, here some future recommendations were<br>provided and please take account them into further research:</p><p>(1) Try to use more data in simulating the invention of the new words on Internet.</p><p>(2) Try to implement a real-time data extraction program and used it into the new words discovery for better simulation quality.</p><p>(3) Pay more attention on the complexity and efficiency of the algorithms designed for this project because lots of IO operations are needed to discover new words. Clumsy algorithms and redundant variables are memory costly and probably affect the result of the simulation. (For example, the robust algorithm discovers new words from <em>k</em> files will cost <em>O</em>(n^k^) time, that makes the new words discovery impossible when <em>k</em> is required to be large)</p><h1 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h1><p>The objective of this project is to study on the existing Chinese segmentation techniques and discover any improvement for the segmentation on informal user generated text. In this project, a long period of study on related topics such as Chinese language theory and natural language processing was done by the student. In the end, four algorithms designed for the improvement upon one of the existing Chinese segmentation product were implemented and tested by the data in different categories. The final result showed one of these algorithms named Active Learning New Word Discovery (Type A) had successfully improved the performance of the Chinese segmentation with informal user generated content like weibo posts.</p><p>This project offered a great opportunity that allowed student to participate into the academic research, find the problem and solve it by learning and experiments independently. During the whole year period of this project, the student has obtained not only the knowledge about the natural language processing and Chinese segmentation, but plenty of practices of time management, project management and programming. In the end, the student was succeeded in implementing some improvement and satisfied the requirement by achieving a higher F-1 score. </p><h1 id="Bibliography"><a href="#Bibliography" class="headerlink" title="Bibliography"></a>Bibliography</h1><p>[1] E.

&lt;p&gt;With the rapid development of social media, website like weibo has become a very important channel of getting information in Chinese speaking regions. In past few years, more and more people chose to use weibo to record what happened around them and express their experience and emotion in daily life due to its highly socialized and real-time features. Human society was greatly speeded up by Internet. And many new vocabularies or new informal writing were invented and widely used in the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
